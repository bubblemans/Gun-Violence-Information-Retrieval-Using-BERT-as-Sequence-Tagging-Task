A man who had recently been laid off from a local hospital opened fire at his Wilmington home today, killing his five young children as well as his wife, police said. The gunman then took his own life, according to authorities. Police said the children were an 8-year-old girl, twin 5-year-old girls and twin 2-year-old boys. LAPD Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner said police found notes inside the house in which the gunman referred to "work-related issues." Police discovered the bodies after a bizarre series of events this morning that included, authorities said, the gunman faxing a letter to KABC Channel 7 shortly before killing himself. Someone, possibly the gunman, called the LAPD about 8:20 a.m. saying, "I just returned home, and my whole family has been shot," according to Garner. Garner said the bodies of the three girls were found in an upstairs bedroom and the bodies of the boys and the mother were found in a back bedroom. Notes found at the house suggested the case was a murder-suicide, he said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-27","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3SRB3E9GJ1KKX

Officials said a the unmarked Louisiana State Police unit was on active patrol around 7 p.m. in New Orleans East, when the trooper noticed a black pickup truck traveling erratically near the Winn Dixie on Chef Menteur Highway. The officers in the unmarked Chevrolet Impala ran the license plate, which revealed the pickup to be stolen from LaPlace. They followed the vehicle and waited for marked police units to conduct a traffic stop. Moment later, the black Chevrolet pickup pulled into the Winn Dixie parking lot and two black males entered the store. Troopers continued following the pickup as it left the parking lot. Upon reaching the intersection of Marques and Grant Drive, someone in the stolen pickup fired several shots at the undercover police vehicle, striking the vehicle at least three times, LSP said. Officials said the troopers were not able to return fire and the pickup fled into the neighborhood. The troopers inside the vehicle were not injured. State troopers are actively searching the area for a 2014 black Chevrolet pickup and the two black male suspects. The vehicle's plate number is C183499.

In this case, the pictures certainly tell the story. FOX6 News showed you the uncanny similarity between the gunman captured on video during a cab driver shooting Sunday on the left, and a photo of Timothy Bunn on the right. Bunn is the man who police say killed himself after taking two hostages to the basement of a house near 76th and Townsend. Now, police say they believe Bunn is also the man who was caught on video robbing a cab driver near 84th and Glendale -- then shooting him in the back. Milwaukee police released this statement to FOX6 News: "I think everyone here feels very fortunate. Our driver, our family member that was involved here is going to recover and be okay," said Paul Sanfelippo, Taxi MKE. At Taxi MKE, Paul Sanfelippo stands next to the cab involved in the crime. He says the camera system worked and so did a key system that uses sensors to turn the car on and off. "They forced the driver out so the gun is to the back of his head. He gets out of the vehicle, something is happening now in this area. The criminal gets back in and we see in the video fumbles around. The car is recognizing 'no key,'" said Sanfelippo. Bunn gets aggressive with the driver, telling him to shut off the car. The sensor however keeps it on but won't let him drive off. The driver and accomplice take off. Until the next crime caught on camera the next night -- a crime that would be their last. There is another suspect police arrested running from the hostage situation. There was an accomplice in the cab driver shooting. We have yet to learn more about that man.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":110,"startIndex":101,"value":"MILWAUKEE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-10","details":{"endIndex":746,"startIndex":729,"value":"76th and Townsend"},"state":"OR - Oregon","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":229,"startIndex":227,"value":"36"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":251,"startIndex":239,"value":"Timothy Bunn"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":229,"startIndex":227,"value":"36"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":251,"startIndex":239,"value":"Timothy Bunn"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AI4J8TH0Y11X5

(CBS4) – A Jefferson County Sheriff’s deputy who was shot and injured while he was off-duty Tuesday night remained in the hospital on Wednesday morning. He was listed in stable condition and his prognosis for recovery was listed as good. Police have arrested one a suspect and they are searching for another in the case. The incident happened at approximately 7:20 p.m. at The Courtyards at Buckley Apartments, located at 17396 East Adriatic Drive. That’s near the intersection of Buckley Road and East Evans Avenue. Police say the deputy was in the parking lot of the apartments when he was approached by two males. Investigators say the two males were trying to rob the deputy and shot at him, hitting him twice. The deputy was able fire back and shot and injured one of the suspects. Both suspects ran off but police were able to capture the suspect who was shot. The injuries to that suspect, a teenager, were described as being non-life threatening. His name is being withheld because he’s a juvenile. An extensive search for the other suspect was unsuccessful overnight. A witness who lives nearby told CBS4 he heard several gunshots and then he tried to help the deputy right afterwards. He said the deputy was in pain and scared. “I held his head up and we put pressure on his wounds,” witness Mike Marshall said. “His gun was lying in the ground about three feet away from him, and his badge and wallet were lying on the other side of him.” “We believe that the motive for this shooting was an attempted robbery,” Aurora police spokesman Sg.t Chris Amsler said. “I’ve been here five years, and this is a quiet end of the building, so when I heard gunshots, I was concerned,” Marshall said.

WTVD reported 27-year-old Tiffany Segule shot Fort Bragg soldier 28-year-old Zia Segule at their home Friday. Officials said Zia Segule returned to the home unannounced shortly after 10 a.m. to surprise his wife with breakfast. The house alarm sounded and the wife shot her husband through a closed bedroom door thinking he was an intruder, according to Fayetteville police. Police said her husband had entered through the front door. It’s unclear whether he announced himself or tried to turn off the alarm. Police said the injured husband was able to walk and talk after the shooting and has since been released from the hospital. There was nothing “accidental” about it. She DELIBERATELY shot him. She didn’t mean to shoot HIM specifically, but the shooting was deliberate. I can tell you as a woman who works at a home where visitors are not expected….I was surprised tonight by the lady who came to administer medicines. My first thought was not ‘shoot to kill’ (although if it were my home….it would be different) But I grabbed the phone to throw my infamous 80mph fastball to the head….until I saw her face. Cocked and ready. The big mistake was marrying “crazy” Tiffany. Next time, make it Hazel or Edna. They would be making breakfast. I’ll have two eggs over easy, bacon, toast and grapefruit juice.

Arthur Papiyan was charged last month with two counts of assaulting a peace officer with a deadly weapon on Jan. 28, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. NEWSLETTER: Stay up to date with what's going on in the 818 >> Early that morning, officers were called to the 99 Cents Only store at Victory Boulevard and Buena Vista Street, where a 36-year-old woman told police that she was kidnapped by a man in a white pickup. Police spotted a white truck heading west on Victory Boulevard and triedto stop the driver, but he took off, speeding through red lights. After a short pursuit, Papiyanstopped at Victory Boulevard and Pass Avenue, where two officers remained by their patrol car with their guns drawn, calling the driver back to them. Papiyan then reversed the truck and slammed it into the patrol car, at which point police shot him. One round pierced the driver's seat and struck Papiyan's back, leaving him bruised. He was treated at a hospital. Neither officer was injured. The womanlater told police she left a house party in south Los Angeles on foot when she accepted a ride from a man, but he didn't get off at the correct freeway exit. She said the driver then put a rag over her face. Next thing she knew, she was out of the truck near railroad tracks, police said at the time. The woman then walked to the 99 Cents Only store and called police. She was arrested on two outstanding misdemeanor warrants for prostitution. Papiyan, who is out of police custody on bail, was not charged with kidnapping because police said, at the time, they had not corroborated the story. He's due back in court in April.

(AP) - An ex-con accused of fatally shooting a police officer who interrupted a drug deal turned himself in Monday, ending an intensive two-day manhunt, authorities said. Tremaine Wilbourn, 29, is accused of killing officer Sean Bolton on Saturday night, after the officer approached a car along a street that had been known for years as a quiet oasis amid a troubled neighborhood. Wilbourn was with his family and an attorney when he turned himself in. "I think he felt the walls closing in and thought it would be in his best interest to turn himself in," Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said Monday. Armstrong spoke briefly to Wilbourn and the suspect told him: "I want you to know that one, I'm not a cold-blooded killer and two, I am not a coward." Armstrong had used that word to describe Wilbourn during the manhunt. On Saturday night, police said Wilbourn was a passenger in a 2002 Mercedes Benz that was parked illegally in the southeast Memphis neighborhood. Bolton approached the car, Wilbourn got out of the Mercedes and the two men got into a struggle, police said. Wilbourn took out a gun and fired, striking Bolton multiple times. Then Wilbourn and the driver ran away as a civilian used Bolton's radio to notify police, authorities said. The driver later turned himself in, and was released without charges. Police sought Wilbourn on a first-degree murder warrant. His first court appearance is expected Tuesday. Officers said they found about 1.7 grams of marijuana in the car. Wilbourn was on probation for an armed bank robbery. A sentencing memorandum filed by Wilbourn's lawyer on May 16, 2006, said Wilbourn was persuaded by his uncle to join the robbery to help him with his finances and "he was awaiting news regarding a possible college scholarship based on his athletic ability." He was sentenced to more than 10 years in federal prison and released on probation in July 2014. He used marijuana in December and was ordered to undergo mental health treatment July 7, according to federal court documents released Monday. It's not clear whether he was ever evaluated. The documents said witnesses to the officer's shooting identified Wilbourn in a photo lineup. Wilbourn, who goes by the names Tremaine Martin and "T-Streetz," is black. Bolton, who was white, was a 33-year-old Marine who served in Iraq. He was the third Memphis officer to be fatally shot in slightly more than four years. His funeral was scheduled for Thursday. Residents along the street where Bolton was gunned down said their block had been quiet compared to the neighborhood around them, where gunshots cut through the night and people are afraid to go outside after dark. Melvin Norment, whose family has lived on the block for 25 years, said he saw the Mercedes on Saturday night and knew it didn't belong to his neighbors. "It's not a car I've seen before," he said. "Because I sit outside all the time. I knew it wasn't anybody's car from around here." Just a few blocks away - at a busy intersection with fast-food restaurants, apartment complexes and an empty lot - police have for years battled drugs and crime in this city long listed among America's most violent. On Monday morning, yellow crime tape rested in a bundle along the curb on Summerlane Avenue. A vase with yellow, red and white flowers and a white stuffed unicorn had been placed at the scene as a make-shift memorial to the fallen officer. The street is lined with small, mostly well-kept homes, and neighbors say it has been insulated from the crime erupting around them. Phillip Price said he lives in Cottonwood Apartments, a few blocks from the shooting. "We hear gunshots all the time," he said. "There's a lot of people here that carry weapons, that shouldn't be carrying weapons. Some of them are trigger happy. We have seven, eight different gangs in this area." Michael Williams lives about three blocks from where Bolton was shot. Williams - a police officer, candidate for mayor and president of the Memphis Police Association - said he was in bed two weeks ago and heard 42 gunshots. When they bought their house eight years ago, "you could be in your front yard and not be concerned, you didn't hear gunshots in the middle of the night, we weren't concerned about going to the gas station at night," he said. But they've watched the neighborhood deteriorate, he said. Homeowners died off or moved to the suburbs, and the renters that replaced them didn't take the same sort of pride in keeping the streets safe and clean, he said. "I even told my wife, 'it's looking like it's time to move on,'" he said. Meanwhile, the number of police officers has dwindled from more than 2,500 in the city to around 2,000, Williams said. Budget cuts dug into officers' pensions and benefits, prompting experienced officers to flee to other departments, in cities with better pay and lower crime rates. Rank and file officers, he said, are disgruntled and burnt out. Williams believes the most recent shooting can be traced, at least to some degree, to the fury over police treatment of African-Americans in incidents across the country. Williams estimates that the Memphis police force is around 60 percent African-American, roughly reflective of the city's overall population. "I think officers are becoming hesitant to react," Williams said. "They don't want to end up in court, or plastered all over the national news." Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

LeGrier, 19, called 911 three times on the morning after Christmas from his father's apartment. But it wasn't until the third call that the city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications sent a squad car to the 4700 block of West Erie Street to check on him. One of the responding officers, Robert Rialmo, fatally shot LeGrier, who the officer said was coming at him with a bat. The officer also accidentally shot and killed a neighbor, 55-year-old Bettie Jones. One of the call takers from OEMC was given a three-day suspension for failing to send a squad car after the teen claimed in his first 911 call at 4:18 a.m. that his life was being threatened, OEMC spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said Tuesday. The call taker who picked up LeGrier's second 911 call, at 4:20 a.m., was suspended for one day after also failing to dispatch police, Stratton said. LeGrier's third call was made at 4:21 a.m., and a different OEMC dispatcher sent the police. A fourth call at 4:24 a.m. was made by LeGrier's father, Antonio LeGrier, who said his son was trying to break into his bedroom with a baseball bat. Lawyers for LeGrier and Jones' families have filed lawsuits against Rialmo and the city for the shooting. In an extremely rare move, Rialmo has countersued LeGrier's estate for more than $10 million in damages. jgorner@tribpub.com Chicago Tribune's Peter Nickeas contributed.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":76,"oldEnd":75,"oldStart":67,"startIndex":68,"value":"Chicago "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-26","details":{"endIndex":504,"startIndex":474,"value":"4700 block of West Erie Street"},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":304,"startIndex":296,"value":"morning "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":567,"startIndex":554,"value":"Robert Rialmo"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":264,"startIndex":262,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":230,"startIndex":213,"value":"Quintonio LeGrier"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":702,"startIndex":700,"value":"55"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":724,"startIndex":712,"value":"Bettie Jones"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	ALTGCNAGZ7PX1

Family members identified the girl as Kimi Reylander. "Sweet little girl, such an artist," said her great uncle George Donahoo. The shooting happened just after 2 p.m. in the 2000 block of Monroe Drive. Authorities told WVTM13 News the shooting took place inside a bedroom in the house.?? Police said the siblings were playing in their great-grandparents' bedroom when they found a gun on the nightstand. The 3-year-old grabbed the gun and shot his 9-year-old sister in the head. "It looks like a tragic accident," said Irondale Police Chief Ken Atkinson. "The great-grandmother was not aware that the pistol was laying on the nightstand." The child was airlifted to Children's of Alabama with life-threatening injuries. She died later Saturday afternoon at the hospital. "We're just depending on God, you know? You just have to give it to Him; that's all we can do," said Donahoo. Police are calling the shooting tragic and believe it is accidental, but it remains under investigation.?? Family members said Kimi loved to spend time at her great-grandparents' house. Her uncle said even though she's not with them any longer, they know where she is. "Kim just accepted the Lord nine months ago so we know she's in Heaven," said Donahoo.

Investigators said two boys were watching TV at a paintball facility in Forney, east of Dallas Saturday night. The five-year-old found a 9 millimeter glock and a six-year-old told him to put it down, said Fred Klingelberger with the Kaufman County Sheriff's Office. When the older child looked away, he heard a shot and found the other boy lying on the floor. He ran to the metal shop to get the adults. The boy regained consciousness and was flown to Children's Medical Center in Dallas, Klingelberger said.

Chief Greg Remson said Security received a complaint at the North Gate from someone who said a resident pointed a rifle at him. Remson said the incident occurred at Lake Clementia among a group of three or four people who knew one another and were at the lake together. Deputies responded to a Security call just before 6 p.m. Jan. 17, according to Sheriff’s Sgt. Lisa Bowman, who said prior to the sheriff’s department arrival, Security officers had located the suspect vehicle and removed both occupants from the vehicle at gunpoint. She said the suspect, Trevor Munier, claimed the weapon was at home, but his father, who was present, opened the trunk of the vehicle and the weapon was there. Bowman identified it as an AR-15 automatic rifle, which is illegal to possess in California. She said Munier was arrested and charged with two felonies -- possession of an assault weapon and felony possession of a deadly weapon with intent to assault. He was also charged with three weapons-related misdemeanors — possession of a large capacity magazine, having a concealed firearm inside a vehicle and carrying a loaded firearm in public. I agree with Wyatt. The configuration is what made that weapon illegal. That and possession of the high capacity magazine, a concealed weapon inside a vehicle, and carrying a loded firearm in public. Any 18 year old person can go puy a California legal AR-15 from any gun store, or build one themselves, that is how he got his hands on it. A few minor modifications and that California legal rifle is now an illegal assault rifle. Sounds to me like the parents have no clue what thier child is up to or have taught him proper gun safety rules. But this is nothing new, today most parents don't know what their children are up to and they don't show an interest in their children or their childrens interests. When your kids act up they need stern discipline not gifts to make them act right.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":993,"oldEnd":992,"oldStart":986,"startIndex":987,"value":"AR-15 "}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":146,"startIndex":132,"value":"Rancho Murieta"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":589,"startIndex":584,"value":"6 p.m"},"date":"2016-01-17","details":{"endIndex":262,"startIndex":248,"value":"Lake Clementia"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":122,"startIndex":120,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":835,"startIndex":822,"value":"Trevor Munier"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[]}	A38OYO6BYY7F7J

A Utah police officer was killed Sunday after he was shot by a suspect who was later killed by police. Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder said Unified police officer Douglas Barney was shot in the head shortly before 10 a.m. in the suburb of Holladay. He was taken to a hospital where he died of his injuries a few hours later. According to Winder, Barney was helping to search for 31-year-old Cory Lee Henderson and a woman. Witnesses said both were riding in a BMW that became involved in a traffic accident with another vehicle. Police said occupants in the other car were seriously injured while Henderson and the woman fled. Shortly after Barney was shot, responding officers encountered Henderson who was on foot. Winder said gunfire erupted with Henderson and police exchanging multiple rounds. Officer Jon Richey suffered three gunshot wounds, including one in the torso. Henderson died at the scene. Winder said Richey was conscious and alert when he saw him in the hospital. He has since undergone surgery and his condition was improving. The woman seen with Henderson was still at large and remained a person of interest, police said. Winder described her as white and blonde. According to witnesses, she stumbled and fell as she was walking away so she might be injured. Barney was an 18-year law enforcement veteran who served in several agencies. He had a wife and three children, the Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office said. Henderson had a prior criminal record that included weapons possession and was sought by a gang task force, Winder said. He also had outstanding federal and state arrest warrants. Police also arrested Henderson’s brother, Jaiden Snyder. According to the Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office, Snyder and Henderson’s mother arrived at the shooting scene and became agitated. Snyder allegedly punched an officer in the face and another officer deployed a Taser. It failed to subdue Snyder but officers were able to take him into custody. He is facing several charges including assault against a police officer and disorderly conduct. It was not known if he had an attorney.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":860,"startIndex":852,"value":"Holladay"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":834,"startIndex":827,"value":"10 a.m."},"date":"2016-01-17","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"UT - Utah","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":994,"startIndex":992,"value":"31"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1022,"startIndex":1004,"value":"Cory Lee Henderson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1786,"startIndex":1780,"value":"white "}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":153,"startIndex":139,"value":"Douglas Barney"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1430,"startIndex":1420,"value":"Jon Richey"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2ZRF4I5RTKN7G

This is absolutely a drug house. This is not a random house that was hit,” said Sheriff Chris Nocco. It wasn’t the first time deputies had been to the home on Garfield Drive in Holiday. There was a home invasion there just five months ago. But early Thursday morning, violence strikes again. Three men burst in likely looking for drugs. In the confusion, one of the people living in the home, fires a shot gun at the attackers. But instead, he hit a 16-year-old girl who was visiting. “The round hits her in the left arm shoulder area; she goes down,” said Sheriff Nocco. She is in the hospital in a medically induced coma. Two other teens, including the victim’s boyfriend, did not stay to help her. Instead, investigators said they ran off to hide their marijuana down the street. “That was their first impulse. Not to save this child, but to get rid of their dope. So they took it to a secondary location,” said Sgt. Dean Quinlan. Residents nearby woke up to deputies pounding at their door. “I was shaking. I didn’t know what was going on. All I heard was banging; my dogs were going nuts. I was calling my parents,” said Briana Reed. While deputies continue to search for whoever busted into the home, they arrested two adults who were inside, including Karen Clark. She’s facing drug charges and three counts of child neglect. The two teens that fled the home were also arrested. “Well it’s still scary living three houses down, but I don’t feel as terrible as a random invasion,” said Reed. The identity of the teen who was shot and is in a coma is not being released yet. The 19-year-old who accidentally shot her was not charged, because investigators said he was shooting in self defense.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":426,"startIndex":419,"value":"Holiday"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-21","details":{"endIndex":415,"startIndex":400,"value":" Garfield Drive"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":508,"startIndex":500,"value":" morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1828,"startIndex":1825,"value":" 19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":126,"startIndex":124,"value":"16"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A17F4I34PD4JZS

Larry "Boxx" Henderson, 30, was found shot on May 3, 2014, in the 2500 block of Huron Street in Westport. He died at a hospital. Almost 19 months since the killing, Alice Oaks still tears up talking about her son and his murder. "Larry's death put me in a place where I wanted to commit suicide, and I got really angry, so I just need some closure. I need closure," Oaks said. Henderson is the second son she has lost to violence. "I'm just so sick and tired every time I see the news someone else is dying. Another mother has to go through this pain," she said. The Baltimore FBI Office is involved in the investigation because of suspected ties to the workings of the Black Guerrilla Family gang. "This particular case does have a federal nexus. It's related to a BGF gang investigation, and we believe when it happened, where it happened, the time of day that (it happened), that someone out there knows what happened," said Scott Hinckley, with the Baltimore FBI office. Henderson was found in the middle of the street. His mother believes he was taken to Westport and for the purpose of being shot. "Larry was basically a loner. He hung with guys, but after a certain time, he started drinking or whatever. He never told me what he did out on the streets, so I don't know why," Oaks said. Investigators said Henderson was known to frequent the area around Carey and Laurens streets. FBI agents and homicide detectives canvassed Huron Street, going?? door to door Wednesday evening. It is unusual for the FBI to get involved in a single local murder case. Much of Baltimore's violence is related, so solving one case can help break others, and Baltimore police could use the help. Currently, Baltimore's homicide clearance rate -- the rate at which cases are closed -- is 31 percent, which is half the national average. Also among the hundreds of Baltimore mothers who have lost their children to violence this year is Nicole Booth. In May, her 18-year-old son, Khai Hebron, was shot and killed by what police told her was also a BGF gang member. "Only by the strength of God am I able to stand here and talk about it," Booth said. In this case, police made an arrest the next day. "Oh God, I am so thankful and I know they have a tough job. My son was murdered in May, May 3, and the crime rate has escalated in Baltimore City, and I just thank God for the detective, and I'm real thankful for him," Booth said. Anyone with information about the investigation in the Henderson case is asked to call the Baltimore FBI at 410-265-8080. Callers' information will remain confidential.

(CBS4) – A man is in custody after a Longmont officer saw someone driving a pickup and firing bullets into the air. The incident happened Saturday night near Martin Street and 1st Avenue. “I heard three shots. And then I looked up to see a truck coming past me and saw four more shots coming out the driver’s side window. And the muzzle flashes,” said Sgt. John Wederquist of the Longmont Police Department. He called for backup and was joined by two other officers in what’s called a felony stop. “It’s kind of a tactic to get the drivers and the occupants of the vehicle under control as best we can, and call them out one at a time from the vehicle,” Wederquist said. Israel Flores-Alvarez began to approach police with hands raised, but the situation soon become unpredictable. “But then he put his hands down and started approaching the officers. At one point he turned and grabbed like he was pulling a gun from his hip. Fortunately we could see that he didn’t have the gun with him. And then he started yelling at us to go ahead and kill him,” Wederquist described. Flores-Alvarez was tased by an officer in a non-lethal ending to the situation. “A search of his vehicle revealed a Smith and Wesson .22LR semi-automatic handgun with live ammunition strewn about the interior of the vehicle. A semi-full can of beer was also located,” Officer Josh Atwell said in the police report. Flores-Alvarez was transported to the hospital for a medical clearance and then taken to jail. “Everyone is safe and home with their families, and he is in jail where he should be,” said Wederquist. He now faces several charges including DUI, reckless negligent discharge of a firearm, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1332,"startIndex":1286,"value":"Smith and Wesson .22LR semi-automatic handgun "}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":89,"startIndex":81,"value":"LONGMONT"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-09","details":{"endIndex":283,"startIndex":255,"value":"Martin Street and 1st Avenue"},"state":"CO - Colorado","time-day":{"endIndex":249,"startIndex":244,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":790,"startIndex":767,"value":" Israel Flores-Alvarez "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

A 17-year-old was arrested Friday night in connection with the January murder of Grant Watkins after detectives served a warrant for his arrest. Watkins was killed Jan. 11 after setting up an alleged drug deal near Blackwell???s Pond Park, in north Carson City, with three people to sell three ounces of marijuana. The investigation has determined that the three at the park, along with five others, had set up the drug deal in an attempt to rob Watkins. During the deal, Watkins was shot in the abdomen and transported to the hospital by a friend, where he died. Reed Skenandore, 21; Jonathan Skenandore, 18; Allen Garcia-Manriquez, 19; Jesus Garcia-Manriquez, 18; Jacob Huttman, 19; Keenan Blackmore, 19; Daniel Lease, 20; and the 17-year-old juvenile have all been arrested and charged in relation to the incident. Reed Skenandore and the Garcia brothers are all charged with felony open murder, felony murder with the use of a deadly weapon committed in the perpetration of a robbery, felony robbery with a deadly weapon, felony attempted murder with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery. Jonathan Skenandore, Huttman, Lease and the juvenile were all arrested on accessory to commit murder and accessory to robbery. Blackmore was arrested on conspiracy to commit a crime and accessory to a felony. ???We continue to work with the District Attorney on this case and the result of that coordination, an additional arrest has been made of a 17-year-old juvenile who has been charged similarly to the rest,??? Sheriff Ken Furlong said. ???We believe this is the last arrest.??? Investigation into the incident was extensive, Furlong said. Detectives also have been searching for three guns, suspected of being involved in the shooting. One weapon was recovered with a search warrant in Lyon County. Two other guns were recovered Feb. 6 after the Carson City Special Enforcement Team conducted a consensual stop on a vehicle at the Rand Convenience Store. The 17-year-old juvenile was a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the stop, though there was no evidence at the time the firearms belonged to him and he was released. Both firearms were reported as stolen and SET seized the weapons. The two firearms are being tested and analyzed to determine whether or not they are the additional murder weapons. As the investigation continued, an arrest warrant was then issued for the same juvenile. The investigation is ???wrapping up??? Furlong said and no other arrests are expected.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":133,"startIndex":122,"value":"Carson City"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-11","details":{"endIndex":425,"startIndex":402,"value":"Blackwell???s Pond Park"},"state":"NV - Nevada","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Yes","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":931,"startIndex":920,"value":"17-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":795,"startIndex":793,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":791,"startIndex":772,"value":"Jonathan Skenandore"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":770,"startIndex":768,"value":"21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":766,"startIndex":751,"value":"Reed Skenandore"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":823,"startIndex":821,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":819,"startIndex":797,"value":"Allen Garcia-Manriquez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":851,"startIndex":849,"value":"18"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":847,"startIndex":825,"value":"Jesus Garcia-Manriquez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":870,"startIndex":868,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":866,"startIndex":853,"value":"Jacob Huttman"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":892,"startIndex":890,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":888,"startIndex":872,"value":"Keenan Blackmore"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":910,"startIndex":908,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":906,"startIndex":894,"value":"Daniel Lease"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":112,"startIndex":110,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":281,"startIndex":268,"value":"Grant Watkins"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A38OYO6BYY7F7J

Authorities are now hoping an increased reward could bring the suspected killers to justice. "They didn't just take my dad's life, they took our lives too," said Stephanie Oliver, Carroll Oliver's daughter. Stephanie, her brother, Cedric, and mother Jolene, wife of 50 years to Carroll, spoke at a Crime Stoppers of Houston press conference Monday, asking for the public's help. "I know for so many people it's not really about the money, but for us it's just about having closure to whatever whoever has done this to my father," Stephanie said. Crime Stoppers of Houston and the Houston Police Department's Homicide Division are asking for the public's help in identifying and locating the suspects. The reward is now $50,000 in the case. The reward was previously $35,000. Oliver was shot on January 11, 2016, around 9:40am in the parking lot of his McDonald's restaurant, located in the 5300 block of the East Freeway. Police say one black man and two Hispanic men intended to rob him. Investigators say one of the suspects shot Oliver during the robbery attempt, then fled westbound on the East Freeway in a white SUV. Oliver died at the scene. Investigators say they've made progress with the case, but would not comment on the current status. Detectives say they continue to look at the possibility this was an inside job. "The great irony in this is that the people who did this to him are the same people that he would give that same opportunity to," said Detective Fil Waters with the Houston Police Department.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":582,"startIndex":575,"value":"Houston"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1084,"startIndex":1078,"value":"9:40am"},"date":"2016-01-11","details":{"endIndex":1179,"startIndex":1149,"value":"5300 block of the East Freeway"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1201,"startIndex":1196,"value":"black"}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1222,"startIndex":1214,"value":"Hispanic"}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1222,"startIndex":1214,"value":"Hispanic"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":104,"startIndex":90,"value":"Carroll Oliver"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME

That waitress was helping another woman outside the bar on Westheimer near Kirkwood. "It's a typical story, you know. The bad thing always happens to the good person, unfortunately," said another waitress Ashley Romano. The good person she's talking about is 24-year-old Cassie Anderson. She's in the hospital now with gunshot wounds on both of her legs. A bullet also went through the window of the Bull and Bear Tavern. The gunman is still on the run. "His face was just completely blank. He wasn't ashamed of what he did. He didn't feel any horror for what he had done. The fact that he was shooting anyone -- just didn't care," said customer Sorcha Costagian. It happened during the height of Sunday afternoon's heavy rain. First, a man tried to steal a customer's car. "The lady saw the gentleman breaking into her car. She went out there, was fighting with him because he was in the vehicle," Costagian said. A male bartender and Anderson ran outside to help out. "The male tried to fire at the male bartender and missed and hit Cassie and he's just torn up about it. He wishes that it had not hit her," said Romano. "As of right now, she is doing well.

1433	http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/01/27/investigation-after-dallas-storeowner-shoots-kills-robbery-suspect/	Dallas Store Owner Shoots & Kills Robbery Suspect « CBS Dallas / Fort Worth	Dallas Store Owner Shoots & Kills Robbery Suspect « CBS Dallas / Fort WorthDALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – A suspected robbery in Dallas ends with deadly gunfire. Now, some are questioning if the shooter will face charges. The front doors of the Shop-N-Go, in the 4900 block of Columbia Avenue at Collett Avenue, were closed and locked on Monday. It’s unclear if or when the store will open. According to Dallas police, it was around 9:30 Tuesday night when several men entered and tried to steal money. Police say at least one of the suspects had a weapon. Owner Bunthan Te said he was in the store working with his wife when everything happened. Te said the suspects jumped over the counter and tried to get to the cash register, which is where his wife also happened to be. Te explained that he saw everything from the back of the store and and when he tried to get his gun out — it got stuck. He said he moved even further back, into the store cooler, when at least one of the suspects starting shooting. Ultimately the storeowner said he was able to get his gun out and return fire. Te said it wasn’t until he went outside, and saw someone on the ground, that he realized someone must’ve been hurt. Two suspects ran from the store and have not been identified or located. There’s a sign in front of the store that says the business is equipped with a surveillance system, but investigators haven’t said if the cameras captured the attempted robbery and shooting on tape. By morning Dallas police officers had left the scene, but department officials say the investigation in the case is ongoing. Te, who came to the U.S. from Cambodia in the early 80’s, said he has had the business for 10 years. Some customers, who did not want to appear on camera or give their names, said Mr. Te is a very nice, older man who they were surprised to hear anyone would want to steal from.

Harris County | abc13.com	Neighbor shoots at home invasion suspects in N. Harris County | abc13.comA concerned neighbor was nearly run over right before he opened fire on two people suspected in a home invasion in north Harris County. Officers say it all happened at a home on Forsythe Lane at Burnwood Lane near Spring. An 80-year-old man was asleep on the second floor of a home when two people kicked in the back door and burglarized the home. A neighbor confronted the two suspects as they were leaving through a back gate carrying Christmas presents and a flat-screen TV. Deputies say the suspects dropped their loot and jumped inside a car before attempting to run the neighbor over. That is when he pulled a pistol out and shot twice into the vehicle. The suspects fled the scene, causing minor damage when they slammed into a parked vehicle.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":714,"startIndex":709,"value":"twice"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":695,"startIndex":689,"value":"pistol"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-21","details":{"endIndex":293,"startIndex":251,"value":"Forsythe Lane at Burnwood Lane near Spring"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[]}	ABQKQQ8BD24BF

At least five people came to the aid of Marvin Jacob Lee, 27, on Friday evening in Catawba County, North Carolina, during the storm that blanketed much of the U.S. East Coast, said Sheriff Coy Reid. The motorist appeared intoxicated, Reid said, so his would-be helpers decided to call law enforcement. On hearing that discussion, Lee opened fire, the sheriff said. "He jumped out of his car with a pistol and started shooting," Reid said, noting one man was struck and fell to the ground. "Then he walked over to that person and shot him several times in the back and killed him." Jefferson Heavner, 26, was lying by the side of the road when law enforcement arrived, the sheriff said. The suspected shooter was sitting in his car and did not respond to commands to leave, prompting a call for a special response team. When backup arrived, Lee appeared to be passed out in the driver's seat, Reid said. The motorist, still armed, awoke as officers approached and was then taken into custody. Lee remained in jail without bond after a court appearance on Monday, the sheriff said. In addition to a charge of murder, he faces four counts of attempted first-degree murder and a charge related to the discharge of his weapon, according to online jail records in Catawba County, about an hour northwest of Charlotte. Heavner was the father of a 17-month-old son and thrived on helping people, his sister told the Charlotte Observer newspaper. Reuters could not immediately contact an attorney for Lee.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":818,"startIndex":812,"value":"severa"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":678,"startIndex":672,"value":"pistol"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":371,"startIndex":356,"value":" Catawba County"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-24","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"NC - North Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":353,"startIndex":346,"value":"evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":334,"startIndex":332,"value":"27"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":330,"startIndex":314,"value":"Marvin Jacob Lee"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":876,"startIndex":874,"value":"26"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":872,"startIndex":855,"value":"Jefferson Heavner"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3LZCR1FDVSVQ8

A man in the restaurant said he heard 5 shots, and a customer said he saw 2 men running westbound on 116th Street. Shell casings were found both inside and outside the restaurant. Neighbors who did not want to be identified say they heard about a half dozen gunshots, and then saw the suspect chasing the victim. The gunfire sent people running in all directions. "I saw sparks, so I proceeded to run and duck, and the shots persisted. About six shots - it was scary, because I had my kids," said one neighbor. For hours, several blocks surrounding the scene was shut down to traffic as dozens of officers canvassed the area for clues. At least three shell casings were found on the street as investigators combed the inside of the restaurant for evidence. "Nothing new. It's the same thing all the time," said George Fergus. The 27-year-old victim went to Harlem Hospital on his own, and is expected to be okay. The suspect fled the scene - one witness says he just casually walked away.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":640,"startIndex":631,"value":"six shots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":73,"startIndex":67,"value":"Harlem"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":119,"startIndex":115,"value":"5:30"},"date":"2015-12-05","details":{"endIndex":187,"startIndex":123,"value":"Empire Corner II restaurant on 1415 5th Avenue near 116th Street"},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1030,"startIndex":1019,"value":"27-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A23KO2TP7I4KK2

First they must figure out who she was. The teen was in the back of a car when she was shot near I-45 and Dyna, according to investigators. Police say the two males with whom she was riding drove her 4 miles north before stopping at about 12:40 am for help at a Whataburger on Airtex. "We don't have much information to go by," said Rhonda Pemberton with the Houston Police Department. Police have so far been unable to identify the girl. The two people she was with could identify her only by nickname, according to a detective with knowledge of the case. They've both been questioned but it's still not clear why anyone would be shooting at the car in which they were all riding. Investigators say the girl was shot in the back but was likely not the intended target. Police are looking for any surveillance video or eyewitnesses who might be able to help them find those responsible. The murder has shaken even those who didn't know the victim. "I stay right down the street right here. To know that stuff is going on like that around here, is pretty crazy," said eyewitness Indra Arteaga.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":169,"startIndex":155,"value":" North Houston"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":431,"startIndex":423,"value":"12:40 am"},"date":"2016-01-03","details":{"endIndex":294,"startIndex":276,"value":"near I-45 and Dyna"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":147,"startIndex":139,"value":" teenage"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]}]}	AM2A8W9J3OPXR

No one is in custody and the three victims are not cooperating with the investigation, police said. It is unclear what sparked the shooting. Also, investigators are trying to determine whether the men were shot outside or inside the hotel, where there was a party, possibly on the 15th floor. The shootings happened shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday. The W Hotel is located in the 600-block of North Lake Shore Drive. At least one man was shot outside, according to iPad video captured by a neighbor. Police said a 25-year old man was standing outside the hotel when someone in a dark-colored SUV got out and opened fire. A Good Samaritan took the man to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he is listed in critical condition. "We all got woken up by several shots," said a witness who declined to be identified. "And when I went to look what's happening I saw a man shot down in the street." Several bullet holes mark the spot where the man was wounded. Others heard arguing and then shots inside the hotel. One hotel guest said: "There was two gunshots inside the hotel and someone cried out someone had been shot." The other victims were a 32-year old man, who was shot in the head, and a 30-year old man, who was shot in the left side. Then took a cab to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center. The hotel's general manager issued a statement which reads, in part, "We are thankful that no registered guests or our talent were injured in the incident during the night, as most of the events occurred outside the hotel. We have been working closely with the authorities throughout their investigation." Meanwhile, some nearby residents said the neighborhood has changed for the worse over the last few years and blame the hotel and its clientele. "Maybe you need to have better security, you need to have people paying attention to what's going on in their bars," said resident Janet Shepard.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":990,"startIndex":983,"value":"several"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":80,"startIndex":73,"value":"Chicago"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-02","details":{"endIndex":233,"startIndex":177,"value":"luxury W Hotel in the upscale Streeterville neighborhood"},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":747,"startIndex":745,"value":"25"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1377,"startIndex":1375,"value":"32"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1426,"startIndex":1424,"value":"30"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A3DI3U61BD56J0

Sheriff: Armed man shot at home after raising gun at deputies | News, Weather, Sports, Breaking News | WSYX	Marion Co. Sheriff: Armed man shot at home after raising gun at deputies | News, Weather, Sports, Breaking News | WSYXMARION — A Marion-area man, shot by Marion County sheriff's deputies Sunday night, remained in critical condition at Grant Medical Center Monday. Investigators said Tim Weiser, 44, was intoxicated in his home, fired a shotgun at them and then raised the gun at them as he walked out of the house. That's when deputies shot him twice. A neighbor said she heard the gunshots earlier in the evening but wasn't alarmed. "We live in the country and didn't think anything of it," said Crystall Gifford. But later police pounded on her door ordering her to leave while they negotiated with Weiser. When deputies first arrived, Weiser fired at them, said Marion County Sheriff Tim Bailey After hours of negotiating, Weiser came out, but apparently not to give himself up. "He had a handgun in his pocket and a shotgun," said Bailey. "They told him to put it down. And in fact he did not put it down, he actually raised it." Deputies shot Weiser and hit him twice. Weiser was flown to Grant Medical Center in Columbus. He is reportedly on a ventilator. Bailey said it's not clear what Weiser was upset about. Marion County deputies are still at the scene of a home where a man was shot during a standoff Sunday night. ABC 6/FOX 28 has learned that deputies shot the man after he walked out of the home and pointed a gun at deputies. According to the Marion County Sheriff's Office, the standoff started about 9 p.m. Sunday. They say the owner a house at 366 Whetstone River Road South was "allegedly intoxicated" and firing a weapon. Deputies arrived at the home and tried to negotiate with 44-year-old Timothy Matthew Weiser. They say he was shooting out of the house's front window toward them. The Sheriff's Office says Weiser came out of the building and raised his gun toward them. That's when deputies shot him, striking Weiser three times. He was taken to Grant Medical Center in critical condition. His current condition has not been publicly confirmed.

Matthews issued an agency statement Sunday afternoon that said Markale Deandra Hart, 22, of Camp Hill, Alabama, was arrested on a felony warrant charging him with murder. Hart was being held Sunday afternoon at the Lee County Jail on $150,000 bond. It was not immediately known whether Hart had an attorney, and the statement didn't provide any details as to how he was taken into custody. Police also disclosed in the statement that Mitchell received multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. The statement said no additional arrests were expected at this time but didn't elaborate on the shooting and arrest. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said in a statement that he was "devastated" by Mitchell's death. "I'm devastated and saddened by the passing of Jakell Mitchell," he said. "My thoughts and prayers are with Jakell's family and friends, who are suffering through this senseless tragedy. I know the Auburn family is hurting, especially our players and coaches, and we are going to love and support them through this difficult time. We have lost a member of our family too young, too soon." Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs expressed his condolences to Mitchell's family on Twitter. The apartment complex was quiet Sunday, with large amounts of broken glass on the ground. Police had spray-painted the ground in spots, apparently marking evidence, and a red car with the license plate "Jakell" was seen being towed away. Mitchell redshirted this season for Auburnout of nearby Opelika High School. He was expected to contend for a starting spot next season at H-back and tight end. Mitchell missed his senior season at Opelika while recovering from an ACL injury. He rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2013 as a junior. Mitchell's girlfriend, Ayanna Hughuley, said Mitchell was arguing with a man in the parking lot when a third man pulled a handgun. She said she didn't know what the argument was about and didn't think Mitchell knew Hart. "He had his gun like this and was looking at Jakell," Hughuley, 17, said of the suspect while holding her hand down at her waistband. "He just started shooting. Jakell fell on the ground, and he tried to get back up and run, and then he fell again. He started shooting at Jakell again while Jakell was on the ground." Drake Ledet, an Auburn sophomore who lives in a building near the complex, told The Associated Press he heard several gunshots shortly after midnight. He said there were two parties going on in the area hours earlier. "I'd say it was at least eight [shots]," Ledet said, adding that he looked out his window. "People were screaming. ... I saw people scattering everywhere, getting in their cars." Jeremy Johnson, a backup quarterback, was one of those who drove up before midday Sunday to see the site and remember Mitchell. Johnson said he wasn't present at the time of the shooting but wanted to come after hearing of his teammate's death. "I couldn't believe it," Johnson said, growing emotional before he left. "Jakell was a real good kid." Sunday's shooting happened at the same apartment complex where Desmonte Leonard killed three men at a party in the summer of 2012. The complex, located a few miles from campus, is popular with students, and its name was changed after the 2012 shooting. In October, jurors convicted Leonard of capital murder in the shooting deaths of former Auburn football players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips, along with DeMario Pitts. Three other people were wounded. Leonard's attorney said the shooting stemmed from a fight, and Leonard fired in self-defense. Prosecutors argued Leonard aimed at the victims and wasn't involved in the initial fight. Leonard will be sentenced Jan. 20. The jury recommended life without parole, but the judge still could sentence him to death.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":2993,"startIndex":2988,"value":"eight"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":77,"startIndex":71,"value":"AUBURN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":310,"value":"12:25 a.m."},"date":"2015-12-13","details":{"endIndex":228,"startIndex":177,"value":"apartment complex near the Auburn University campus"},"state":"AL - Alabama","time-day":{"endIndex":170,"startIndex":163,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":567,"startIndex":565,"value":"22"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":563,"startIndex":543,"value":"Markale Deandra Hart"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":400,"startIndex":398,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":136,"oldEnd":135,"oldStart":119,"startIndex":120,"value":"Jakell Mitchell "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A27LE9HE55KLUF

1876	http://abc27.com/2016/01/28/da-to-make-announcement-in-fatal-eviction-shooting-case/	Duncannon father charged with homicide in daughter’s eviction shooting	Duncannon father charged with homicide in daughter’s eviction shootingDUNCANNON, Pa. (WHTM) – A Perry County man has been charged with criminal homicide in the death of his 12-year-old daughter during an eviction confrontation with a constable. Donald B. Meyer Jr. was awaiting arraignment Thursday on the homicide charge and an additional count of involuntary manslaughter, District Attorney Andrew Bender said. Bender said Meyer’s “willful and deliberate reckless behavior” caused the death of 12-year-old Ciara Meyer. He said by pointing a loaded rifle at the constable, knowing his daughter was nearby, Meyer “consciously disregarded an unjustifiable and extremely high risk” that his actions could cause her death. “We came to the conclusion to add the homicide charge because the investigation showed that but for Mr. Meyer’s reckless actions, Ciara would still be here,” Bender said. “He put her in a situation where his reckless actions triggered a chain of events that unfortunately led to this death.” Bender added that Constable Clarke Steele has been cleared of any wrongdoing and will not face any charges. He said Steele fired in self-defense when Meyer placed him in “imminent and immediate fear for his life.” Ciara Meyer was shot and killed Jan. 11 as Steele was trying to evict the family from the Pfautz Apartments in Penn Township. State police said the girl was standing directly behind her father when Steele fired a single shot that went through Meyer’s left upper arm and struck his daughter in the chest. Police said Meyer had opened the door for Steele, closed it, then opened it again. As Meyer exchanged words with the constable, he leveled a .223 caliber, semi-automatic rifle that had been slung and concealed along his body. With the rifle pointed directly at his chest, police said Steele, who was in uniform, fired his .40-caliber duty firearm. Meyer, 57, was previously charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, terroristic threats, and reckless endangerment. He has been held in Perry County Prison without bail since his release from a hospital last week. Authorities have additionally charged him with a second count of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and a firearms violation. Bender said Meyer could not legally own a firearm because of a previous involuntary mental health commitment. According to a search warrant affidavit, police removed five guns from the Meyer home after the shooting. Police said Meyer falsified applications when he purchased the guns. The .233 caliber rifle had a 30-round magazine and was ready to fire, and police said Meyer had a Colt M4 and other loaded guns, plus a cache of loaded magazines prepared in the kitchen and dining area, including eight 30-round magazines on a kitchen chair just inside the front door. Caira’s uncle told ABC 27 the family is happy to hear of the additional charges. ABC 27’s Kendra Nichols is following developments. Look for updates online and on the air.

Chambers' worst fears apparently were realized early Saturday, when police said a man named Ronnie Chambers, 33, was fatally struck when a gunman or gunmen opened fire on a van Chambers was riding in just after it arrived in the 1100 block of South Mozart Street. Family friends and neighbors confirmed Chambers was the fourth and last child of Shirley Chambers, who could not be reached for comment Saturday. "He was the last one," said family friend Laverne Smith, 30. "I know she's hurting." Smith said it's unthinkable this could have happened again to the family. "It's ridiculous," Smith said. "We need to get the guns off the street and build a good life for our babies. We need to really get together and stop fighting." Smith, who lives near where the shooting occurred, said she heard loud gunfire about 2 a.m. and ran outside to find Ronnie Chambers shot in the head. She said he died in her arms. Smith said she also knew Chambers' sister, LaToya Chambers, and had grown up with them in the Cabrini-Green neighborhood on the Near North Side. LaToya was a classmate, about two years ahead, at Edward Jenner School, she said. LaToya was killed at age 15 in the lobby of a Cabrini-Green high-rise April 26, 2000, during an argument between her boyfriend and a 13-year-old boy, who was later convicted. Her brothers Carlos and Jerome also were gunshot victims. Carlos, then 18, was shot and killed just after Thanksgiving 1995 at the corner of Jackson Boulevard and State Street, apparently by a boy with whom he'd had an argument. Jerome was shot and killed at age 23 on July 26, 2000. He had reportedly been standing at a pay phone in the 400 block of West Chicago Avenue when a maroon van pulled up and its occupant opened fire. According to a 2000 Tribune story, Ronnie Chambers had tattoos on his forearms to remind him of his dead siblings: a crucifix with a ribbon draped across it commemorated Carlos, a tombstone with a crucifix was for Jerome and another tombstone with a cross honored LaToya. "They say you can't outrun death, but I can try to dodge it," Ronnie said then. "I don't even try to live day by day anymore; it's more like second by second." After his death Saturday, Smith called Ronnie Chambers "my everything. I lost a part of me. ... Nothing that anyone can say can make me feel better." In a December appearance on the "The Ricki Lake Show," Chambers identified himself as a former gang member who was trying to help others stay away from that kind of life. Police said he'd been arrested 29 times and had four felony convictions. Records show his most recent conviction was in 2005 for receiving, possessing or selling a stolen motor vehicle. He was sentenced to three years in the Illinois Department of Corrections, records show. Chambers, whose nickname was "Scooby," had been "trying to change his life," Smith said. He worked in the music business, and had returned from an event for YK, an aspiring rapper he was trying to help, when the shooting occurred, Smith said. Smith, her clothes stained with blood, stood crying at one end of a vacant lot in the Lawndale neighborhood on the West Side early Saturday morning while Chambers lay covered by a white sheet behind a maroon van at the other end. At least one other man, 21, was inside the van when the shooting started, police said. He had jumped from the front passenger seat to the back, quick thinking that police said probably saved his life. He was wounded in the thigh and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. Police did not say how many people were inside the van. They also did not say exactly how many shooters there were, but did say seven shots were fired. The shooting happened across the street from Safer Foundation North Lawndale, an Illinois Department of Corrections transitional facility for adults with criminal records, and half a block west of a fire station. Family and friends, none of whom wanted to give their names, circled the north end of the scene, marked by yellow tape hung around trees, light poles and police cars. Back in 2000, Ronnie Chambers told the Tribune he had trouble accepting the deaths of his siblings "for no reason." "I ask myself, 'Why am I still here?' Out of all of them, I was the one who got in trouble," he said. "They didn't do anything wrong." At the time, his mother said that, some days, she didn't want to live. "But," she said, "I have to be strong for Ronnie."

Witnesses say the 18-year-old was shot to death by his friend. Police responded to a call of shots fired around 9:45 p.m Saturday on South Santa Fe Drive near Dartmouth Avenue. Officers found the teen victim shot dead inside of a car in the parking lot of a mobile home park. CBS4’s Melissa Garcia spoke exclusively with the mother of one of the boys involved in the deadly incident. “It was an accident,” said Emma Rios, the mother of the victim’s friend. In Spanish, Rios said that her son had been hanging out with some friends outside of her Englewood home when the gun went off. “They were playing with the pistol,” said Rios, “they didn’t realize the gun was loaded.” The 17-year-old boy who fired the shot is in police custody, charged with second degree murder. “He’s a good kid,” said Rios, of the shooter. “He used to come over here a lot with my son.” As Englewood police actively investigate the shooting, they haven’t released details including where the teens got the handgun. Police have not released the name of the suspect because he is a juvenile. The release of the victim’s identity is pending notification of his family. Melissa Garcia has been reporting for CBS4 News since March 2014.

The dramatic incident unfolded Friday in Hunting Park, and it was all caught on camera. Maria Rivera was cooking dinner just after 5 p.m. at her home in the 600 block of West Venango Street when she heard gunshots. She ran to the door, worried that her husband may have been hit by a stray bullet on his way to the corner store. She and her daughter were in for a shock. "I didn't know what to think," she told Action News. The only words that came were, "Oh my god!" she said. The moment was captured by her surveillance cameras. "Soon as we opened the door, boom, it hit us. I didn't know what was going on, my daughter did not know. I went in the house," Rivera said. It was later learned someone had fired several shots at two people who were inside a van. The driver of the van lost control, hit a handicapped parking sign and slammed into Rivera's brand new 2016 Kia. "I'm looking down towards 7th Street, and I noticed the van go into reverse. I didn't think it was going to come towards us, and it just went too fast," Rivera said. That was just the beginning. "It just slammed into the house, into my car, reverse back, slammed into my house, slammed into the car, reverse back, slammed back into the car, brought it up to the sidewalk, reverse and then took it," Rivera said. "Made a new parking spot right in front." Rivera's car was hit five times. Her daughter's car, which was parked right behind Rivera's, was also heavily damaged. Seconds later, cameras show the two men who were shot fleeing the scene on foot. Both cars were totaled. Rivera's home also suffered damage from the collision. She's insured, but she'll have to pay a $1,000 deductible on the house and another $500 on her car. "And then I have to go get another loan and then go get a car. It's keeping me not only from work, but from my daily duties.

The incident happened at the Hampton Inn on 135th Avenue in South Ozone Park around 8:45 p.m. The victim, an English teacher, had left her daughter in the passenger's seat of her car while she went inside, when police say a masked suspect jumped out of a vehicle parked directly behind them. Authorities say the suspect opened the driver's-side door, pistol-whipped the daughter and demanded her jewelry. The mother returned to the car and confronted the suspect, and during a struggle, she was shot once in the chest. The suspect, who was wearing a ski mask, fled with at least one other man in a white sedan. The mother's wallet and cell phone were taken, as was the daughter's rings. The mother was rushed in critical condition to Jamaica Hospital, where she has since been upgraded to stable. The daughter was taken to Queens Hospital Center to be checked out. The investigation is ongoing, and no arrests have been made. Police say there is an ongoing pattern with two other similar robberies in the area, one of them in the same hotel parking lot, and they are looking to see if they are linked. Hotel surveillance video shows a white Volkswagen Jetta with New York license plates following the victims' car into the parking lot and stopping directly behind it.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":775,"startIndex":770,"value":" once"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":248,"startIndex":242,"value":"Queens"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":363,"startIndex":355,"value":"8:45 p.m"},"date":"2016-01-21","details":{"endIndex":347,"startIndex":315,"value":"135th Avenue in South Ozone Park"},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":269,"startIndex":264,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":96,"startIndex":93,"value":" 53"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":199,"startIndex":197,"value":"20"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A3FPPZWMQOANR4

2175	http://articles.courant.com/2013-12-08/community/hc-manchester-shooting-1208-20131207_1_three-women-gunshot-child	Four Dead After Apparent Triple Murder-Suicide In Manchester - tribunedigital-thecourant	Four Dead After Apparent Triple Murder-Suicide In Manchester - tribunedigital-thecourantMANCHESTER — The man who shot three women and then killed himself in Manchester late Saturday night had fathered a child with one of the female victims and was involved in a child support dispute with her, according to family members and court records. For the past two weeks, Brittany Mills, 28, a standout basketball player at Weaver High School, class of 2004, had been trying to end a relationship with John Louis Lynn, the father of their 13-month-old son, members of Mills' family said Sunday. Earlier this year, a Superior Court judge had ordered Lynn to pay child support. Mills later sought a contempt finding and a wage garnishment against Lynn. The case remains open, records show. After Mills ended the on-again, off-again, five-year relationship two weeks ago, Lynn "was over there all the time," said Mills' sister, Tashua Parker. "She was trying to stop him from coming." Parker said Lynn, 41, and Mills had a strained relationship. "It wasn't physical … we just didn't think it would ever go this far," Parker said. Until late Saturday night. Concerned that Mills wasn't answering her phone Saturday, Mills' two cousins, Kameisha Mills, 23, of Manchester, and Artara Benson, 46, of Vauxhall, N.J., had gone to check on Mills at her apartment at 190 Pine St., family members said. At 9:40 p.m., Manchester police received reports of multiple gunshots at 190 Pine St. in the Dye House apartments. Police arrived within minutes and confronted a man in the parking lot of the apartment building. The man was armed with a handgun and carrying a 13-month-old child, Capt. Christopher Davis said in a statement. After a confrontation with officers, "it appears [the suspect] put the child on the ground before shooting himself,'' Davis said. "One officer also fired one shot at the suspect, but it does not appear that the suspect was struck by the officer's bullet.'' The child, unharmed by the gunfire, was transported to a hospital for evaluation, Davis said. "The officers' quick response to the scene prevented the suspect from being able to flee with the child and likely saved the child's life,'' the captain said. Meanwhile, Davis said, patrol officers searched the apartment and found three women dead from gunshot wounds. The officers had to force entry, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the case who requested anonymity. Inside, they encountered a horrific scene — three women in the living room, all lying on the floor, each with severe head trauma and apparently dead, the official said. The women were in separate areas of the living room. They were all clothed. The apartment appeared to be neat and clean, the officer said. The medical examiner on Sunday determined that Lynn's death was a suicide and that Brittany Mills, Kamesha Mills, and Benson were homicide victims. Brittany Mills had multiple gunshot wounds to the head; Kamesha Mills and Benson had single gunshot wounds to the head. Lynn died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Patrol officers treated the call as an active shooter incident and took measures to assure no one else was in the apartment or outside in the complex. Detectives were then called in to process the crime scene. Sharell Foster, a third-floor tenant, said she knew one of the women from school and that the woman had lived at Dye House Apartments for about a year. Foster said her daughter heard shots and Foster had seen the body of the man lying between cars in the parking lot after the police arrived. Harold Arna, who was visiting his girlfriend who lived next door to the woman, said he had just sat down to watch TV when he heard women screaming. "I heard women yelling — I didn't hear a guy yelling — then I heard a pop, pop, pop," Arna said. After hearing the shots, Arna said, he ran to his girlfriend — who was doing laundry — and told her to get down. Arna said his girlfriend immediately called the police. "While my girlfriend was on the phone with the police, we still heard a woman screaming and more shots, then nothing," he said. He said he and his girlfriend didn't know the woman. One of the shots nearly entered through their kitchen and was lodged in the wall, he said. Family members said Brittany Mills was working with special needs children. "She smiled all the time," Parker said. "She was beautiful, and she was told all the time she should model because she was tall and skinny." Brittany Mills' Facebook page shows a beaming Mills, her cheek pressed up against the face of her baby boy. Richard Allen, of Long Island, N.Y., who was with the family Sunday in their Hartford home, said he had had planned to propose to Benson on Christmas Day. They had been seeing each other for two years, he said. Benson had a 21-year-old child. — FoxCT's Crystal Hall contributed to this report.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1453,"startIndex":1435,"value":" multiple gunshots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1628,"startIndex":1621,"value":"handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":99,"startIndex":88,"value":"MANCHESTER "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1395,"startIndex":1386,"value":" 9:40 p.m"},"date":"2015-12-09","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":995,"startIndex":992,"value":" 41"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":510,"startIndex":495,"value":"John Louis Lynn"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":383,"startIndex":381,"value":"28"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":379,"startIndex":365,"value":"Brittany Mills"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1243,"startIndex":1241,"value":"23"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":1239,"startIndex":1225,"value":"Kameisha Mills"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1281,"startIndex":1279,"value":"46"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":1277,"startIndex":1263,"value":" Artara Benson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":995,"startIndex":992,"value":" 41"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":510,"startIndex":495,"value":"John Louis Lynn"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AVT70WXOWRHGI

UPDATE: The Orange County Sheriff's Department told ABC11 they have one person in custody. Read more here. Family friends said a bullet hit Maleah Williams in the head during a drive-by shooting. GOFUNDME PAGE FOR MALEAH WILLIAMS Larunda Craig is the little girl's godmother. "It's senseless, very senseless," she said. "Respect for the kids, nobody. And I just think who ever did this senseless crime needs to be caught." It happened around 5:40 p.m. in the 700 block of Trinity Court. Officers said the shots were fired from a vehicle leaving the apartment complex. Police said Maleah remains in critical condition at UNC Hospitals. Eyewitnesses say before the shooting, kids were outside playing with their new toys from Christmas. Parents were standing nearby, watching the children play. Eyewitnesses said when someone drove up and opened fire, kids started screaming, and parents were panicking. One of the bullets pierced Maleah as she was being held in her mother's arms. "The mama didn't even realize the girl was hit until she got around the corner and realized the little girl was bleeding from the head," said Craig. Maleah, who is affectionately called "Peanut," has undergone two surgeries, according to friends of the family. "I hope they catch the suspect and I hope that he gets a death sentence, and is treated just like Maleah. Maleah is suffering right now and I think they should suffer as well because she did not deserve any of this," said Craig. No other kids were injured during the shooting. Police are investigating and asking anyone with information about the incident to call 911 or Crime Stoppers at (919) 942-7515.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":11,"startIndex":0,"value":"Chapel Hill"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":656,"oldEnd":655,"oldStart":645,"startIndex":646,"value":"5:40 p.m. "},"date":"2015-12-25","details":{"endIndex":689,"startIndex":663,"value":"700 block of Trinity Court"},"state":"NC - North Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":69,"startIndex":68,"value":"1"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":359,"startIndex":344,"value":"Maleah Williams"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A27LE9HE55KLUF

The second victim, a 30-year-old male, was being treated at an area hospital for wounds in the stomach. The identities of the two men were not immediately released.

2254	http://abc11.com/1144118/	Sheriff: Step-father shoots, kills teenage stepson in Fuquay-Varina | abc11.com	Sheriff: Step-father shoots, kills teenage stepson in Fuquay-Varina | abc11.comA Harnett County man is accused of shooting and killing his 19-year-old stepson who was home for the holidays to visit family and friends. The incident happened around 12:40 p.m. Saturday afternoon on Ruth Circle in Fuquay-Varina. The Harnett County Sheriff's Office says there was a domestic dispute between the two which led to the shooting. The victim, Raekwon Shannon of Spokane, Washington, was taken to Central Harnett Hospital where he died of his injury. 40-year-old Rico McConico is charged with first degree murder. "I want to know what was so bad that they argued about that he had to kill," said Jessica Romero, who is Shannon's friend. "You just don't kill someone over a fight." Romero has spent the last few days hanging out with Shannon during his much anticipated trip home. He was in the Army Reserve and was killed just before he was set to head back to Washington State. "It's hard because we were going to hang out again, like friends do," said Romeo. "Now we can't do that." McConico is being held at the Harnett County Detention Center without bond. He is scheduled to appear before a judge Monday.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":308,"startIndex":295,"value":"Fuquay-Varina"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":257,"startIndex":247,"value":"12:40 p.m."},"date":"2016-01-02","details":{"endIndex":291,"startIndex":280,"value":"Ruth Circle"},"state":"NC - North Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":276,"startIndex":267,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":544,"startIndex":542,"value":"40"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":567,"startIndex":554,"value":"Rico McConico"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":141,"startIndex":139,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":450,"startIndex":435,"value":"Raekwon Shannon"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A1LUIICJ3AAOD7

Melvin Swift, a member of the Trinity Valley Community College basketball team, was shot in the 3200 block of Jorns, just a block from his family home. Police say the family that lives on Jorns came home around 8pm. One of the young children found a a man in her room, allegedly holding a knife.

The two step-brothers were inside their parents' home to feed and water the family dog. Neither were living at the home. The 20-year-old step-brother, who is in college, was showing his brother the gun when the accident happened. "The 20-year-old wanted to show the 15-year-old an automatic pistol, and while handling the pistol he accidentally discharged it," said HPD Homicide Sgt. Joel Burton. The 15-year-old died, despite his step-brother's attempt to save him with CPR. The victim had been shot in the torso, in what police described as a tragic accidental shooting. Police said the oldest son knew where it was kept. The gun belonged to the father of the oldest son, who serves as captain of Precinct 1 Constable Alan Rosen's staff. Investigators say because no juveniles lived in the home, it is not a case of making a firearm accessible to a child. He was in San Antonio when he received a call about the shooting and is "devastated". "I think that's an understatement," said Rosen. "He is devastated beyond belief. This is a tragic, tragic situation. They were relatives, and even if they weren't, it doesn't get more tragic than this." Members of the constable's staff spent Saturday outside the home, comforting friends and family members. The case will be turned over to the District Attorney's Office for review. The name of the victim is not being released at this time.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":516,"startIndex":500,"value":"automatic pistol"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":217,"startIndex":208,"value":"Meyerland"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-16","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":204,"startIndex":195,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":346,"startIndex":344,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":119,"startIndex":117,"value":"15"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2OUANFKZAFZF2

The shooting happened around 10 p.m. Wednesday at the Clinton House Apartments on Kenilworth Street, in a neighborhood along Woodward Avenue just south of West Chicago Boulevard. Jessie Boswell had just finished visiting his grandmother when he was shot multiple times in the parking lot and died. The shooting was captured on video that was shown to Boswell’s relatives. Angela Bea, the boy’s aunt, told WWJ’s Charlie Langton that the suspect was hiding in the bushes as if they were waiting for Boswell to exit the building. “Some guy ran up behind this pole right here… and he shot seven times and killed my nephew. He came out the bushes and just started shooting,” said Bea. “He just went in the house to see his grandmother for a minute and came out and got ready to get in the car and the guy just start, just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, you know, just blasting.” Bea, who was visibly distraught, said the whole thing doesn’t make any sense to her. “Just out in the open, he shot the lady’s car right here, the white truck over there, shot that car, you know, just out in the open, just shooting and killing people. It’s sad,” she said. “Excuse me y’all, but I’m tripping right now.” Police are now looking for the gunman, who fled the scene on foot. Investigators are also reviewing the security footage to get a description of the shooter.

(Dec. 10, 2015) – A traffic stop led to a chase and police action shooting that left a man in critical condition, police said Thursday. According to Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Richard Riddle, an officer made a traffic stop around 1:30 a.m. for a license plate violation, but the vehicle took off and officers pursued. Officers saw the man run into a home in the 2100 block of Conrad Avenue. That's on the near southwest side of Indianapolis. Police identified the suspect as Jason Bryant, 34, of Indianapolis. Police obtained a search warrant and then entered the home around 5:30 a.m. Riddle said Bryant confronted the officers with a gun in a back bedroom. Two officers opened fire and struck the suspect, who was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. He later succumbed to his injuries. A .380 handgun was recovered after the search. Police said the truck Bryant was driving had been stolen from New Whiteland on Nov. 23, 2015. No officers were hurt during the incident, Riddle said. Bryant was out on bond for a separate criminal case, in which he was charged with dealing and possession of methamphetamine over 10 grams and being a serious violent felon in possession of a handgun. Officers involved in the shooting will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such cases. The shooting remains under investigation.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":930,"startIndex":916,"value":" .380 handgun "}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":85,"startIndex":73,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":688,"value":" 5:30 a.m"},"date":"2015-12-08","details":{"endIndex":502,"startIndex":489,"value":"Conrad Avenue"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":604,"startIndex":602,"value":"34"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":600,"startIndex":588,"value":"Jason Bryant"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Weber said officers were called out for a possible domestic incident around 8:00 p.m. When they arrived, a chase ensued between officers and someone who was fleeing the scene. Chief Weber said that person produced a knife, or some sort of edged weapon, and an officer was attacked. The officer was taken to Froedtert Hospital for treatment. The extent of injuries suffered is unknown at this time. The suspect was shot by at least one officer, Weber said. The condition of the suspect is unknown. Additionally, officers on scene discovered a deceased female near one of the apartments. Officers are working to determine the female's connection to the officer-involved shooting and the domestic violence incident that prompted the police response. Weber said officers were dealing with two crime scenes. The Milwaukee Police Department is handling the investigation into the officer-involved shooting. Agree!!! We need an executive order to implement more stringent laws regarding who is allowed to own edged devices that can be used as weapons (kitchen cutlery, box cutters, hunting knives, pocket knives, multi tools with knives and craft exacto knives). We need to do something proactive that will stop the edged weapon violence in this city. The article makes it pretty clear that this was a domestic violence situation fool. If the couple can afford to life in Miranda village chances are there working class as well you racist goon. What does “race” have to do with this particles matter in the east bit?! Especially seeing how the overwhelming majority of domestic violence convictions according to the FBI are Caucasion males?! Hmm.. Race has a lot to do with it. Depending on who your target is; reporting on a story about an officer, a knife, a dead women and shooting are all scary things especially in Tosa.OMG. Ya see, reading the words “lung cancer” usually generates an affect of dread, while reading the words “mother’s love” usually generates a feeling of affection and comfort. It’s called The Affect Heuristic. You should also study rhetoric.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":106,"startIndex":97,"value":"WAUWATOSA"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":384,"startIndex":376,"value":"8:00 p.m"},"date":"2016-01-12","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Deputies arrested 41-year-old Columbia resident Cheri Lynn Blocker and charged her with second-degree murder. She was released after posting $250,000 bond. Moser was staying with Blocker and her husband, Jeffrey, in a mobile home near Rock Springs Road and Sowell Mill Pike east of Columbia, Sheriff Bucky Rowland said based on reports from his investigators. An argument between Moser and Jeffrey Blocker turned physical, Rowland said, and Cheri Blocker ran to her bedroom and retrieved a handgun. “She came back, fired one shot and struck the victim,” Rowland said. Cheri Blocker called 911 and cooperated with investigators until she was advised of her Miranda rights and placed under arrest, Rowland said. “Our folks administered CPR, but he [Moser] was pronounced dead on the scene,” Rowland said. Moser’s daughter was upset Blocker was released on bond. “It is absolutely crazy how they can let someone out on bond, and set a bond for a murder charge. She’s out living her life, while I’m having to bury my father,” Heather Moser wrote in a Facebook message to The Daily Herald. The shooting was the second tragedy in less than two years for the Moser family. Moser’s twin brother, Todd, was the sole victim in a Columbia trailer fire in February 2014. Moser was living most recently in Burns and involved with Set Free Ministries, according to his obituary from Williams Funeral Home. Burns is a small town in Dickson County, population 1,500, just east of Dickson and north of Interstate 40. Moser was survived by his father and stepmother, Walter “Whiz” K. Moser, Jr. and Deborah Moser; his daughter, Heather; and his son, Kyle. A private memorial service will be held at a later date, the funeral home said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":748,"startIndex":739,"value":"one shot "},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":715,"startIndex":708,"value":"handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":65,"startIndex":57,"value":"Columbia"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-29","details":{"endIndex":163,"startIndex":151,"value":"Wentzel Lane"},"state":"MO - Missouri","time-day":{"endIndex":147,"startIndex":132,"value":"Tuesday morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":238,"startIndex":236,"value":"41"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":283,"startIndex":266,"value":"Cheri Lynn Blocke"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":95,"startIndex":93,"value":"48"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":91,"startIndex":73,"value":"Walter Scott Moser"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A22K31FFQVQL9H

"The family is just devastated," said Boring. "Everybody loved my dad so I never in a million years would have seen this coming." Police captured the second suspect in the case, Proudstar Wilson, 21, after she went on the run from law enforcement for three weeks, according to investigators. Lt. Pete Brindley of the Redding Police Department said they investigated leads and tips and found Wilson in a home on Strawberry Lane in Anderson. Police believe the man who shot Boring is Robert Pasillas, who turned himself in after being on the run as well. Jessika said Pasillas and her father were close, Pasillas even called him 'dad.' "I don't know what the motive was," she said, holding back tears. Jessika said she feels better now that Wilson and Pasillas have been caught, but she's still in fear for her life. Jessika said people have started to break into her father's home in Redding and steal things. "There are people watching me as I'm trying to clean his house and it's an uneasy feeling," Boring said. "It's scary." Jon Boring owned his own car restoration business, and police believe it might have been a car deal gone wrong. "I think everyone will remember my dad's smile and his corny jokes," she laughed. "He was creative and very hard-working. He was very honest." Jessika would like to invite the public to a potluck celebration of life in honor of her father. It will be at the Elks Lodge in Redding on February 20th from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Anyone is welcome to come and bring food.

Seattle Assistant Police Chief Robert Merner said police received reports of gunfire Tuesday night. Officers searched an area referred to as "The Jungle" and found five victims. One man was declared dead at the scene, and another man died at Harborview Medical Center, where two victims are in critical condition and one other in serious condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Police searched the area for the suspects but decided the shooters had left the area, Merner said, adding that police have two persons of interest they will seek in connection with the shooting. Though the suspects are still at large, Merner said other homeless encampments have no reason to fear a shooting from the same suspects. "We have reason to believe it was very targeted as far as what happened there tonight," Merner said. Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole said the victims were not targeted because they were homeless. "They were targeted specifically for who they were," O'Toole said, adding that there is no reason to believe there is an ongoing danger related to the shootings. Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said the victims ranged in age from 25 to 45 and that they sustained gunshot wounds to their chests, abdomens and other parts of their bodies. The shooting happened just before Seattle Mayor Ed Murray delivered a major speech about helping the homeless in the city. "I just want to reiterate what I said earlier tonight - we are involved in a homeless crisis, the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression," Murray told the press following the shooting. He said an emergency order addressing homelessness that the city issued Jan. 19 was "not a gimmick," but a plea that the city cannot deal with the problem alone. The area known as "the jungle," Murray said, "has been out of control for almost two decades." He said in the next 48 hours the state, county and city governments will launch an assessment to better understand how the situation can be addressed. "This is a tragedy. It involves homeless people and the causes of homelessness are complex there is no simple answer," Murray said. "This is a time for us to once again try to solve this crisis. No city in America can deal with a crisis this large without our state and federal governments stepping up."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":252,"startIndex":245,"value":"Seattle"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-27","details":{"endIndex":407,"startIndex":372,"value":"an area referred to as \"The Jungle\""},"state":"WA - Washington","time-day":{"endIndex":352,"startIndex":347,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9

Steve Cartigiano says his son, 16-year-old James, was accidentally shot by a teenage friend and later died. He says James went to a sleep over at the friend's house in suburban Delray Beach on Jan. 22. Cartigiano's lawyer, Gary Lesser, says there were several unsecured, loaded guns in the home. Lesser says no adults were at the home when the boy living there accidentally shot James Cartigiano. He died Jan. 27. Now, the Cartigiano family and Lesser want to raise awareness about gun safety. They say guns should be locked, kept in a secured place and never handled without adult supervision. Lesser says he is drafting a civil lawsuit against the family which owns the home and the gun, and possibly others. A spokesperson from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says there is an open criminal investigation into the incident. No one has been charged at this time. Detectives believe the shooting was accidental The Cartigianos say no family should go through what they've experienced. They're hoping their loss can be a wake-up call to gun owners.

A woman who lives in the neighborhood, and doesn't want to be identified, says the gunfire woke her up but she wasn't surprised to hear it. "I heard six shots," she said. "I'm used to it. It's a natural thing, but it was so close." The shooting happened near Fillmore and Turk street around 9:20 Thursday night, on the same block as a police sub-station. Police will only confirm there was a shooting and that an innocent bystander was hit in the upper torso. ABC7 News has learned that victim is a cab driver with Yellow Cab and has been released from the hospital. "When I heard this news, I was scared," said Ram Dahal, a cab driver with Yellow Cab. "Probably 99 percent of passengers you pick up just want to get some place. What's going on the sidewalk or street, you really don't have a hell of a lot of control over sometimes," explained Travis, also a cab driver.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":325,"startIndex":321,"value":" six"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":96,"startIndex":83,"value":"San Francisco"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":468,"startIndex":464,"value":"9:20"},"date":"2015-12-31","details":{"endIndex":457,"startIndex":427,"value":"near Fillmore and Turk street "},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":483,"startIndex":478,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A3E3OELJKHW58C

He died a short time later at an area hospital. The shooting left another teen critically wounded, with a gunshot wound to the thigh. It was just after 10:30 p.m. Sunday when multiple 911 calls brought officers to the 500 block of North Creighton Street at Wyalusing Avenue. There they found Glover, who had been in the head, arm and leg. Homicide investigators say an argument preceded the shooting. "We are hearing those two males got into an argument with an unidentified male and female. The male pulled out a gun and started shooting at the two 17-year-olds," said Capt. James Clark of the Homicide Unit. Neighbor Ben Gerald told Action News he heard "like 5 gunshots - bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, you know? I wasn't about to stick my head out there." Around the corner from the shooting scene, in the 500 block of Paxon Street, the teen wounded in the thigh managed to sprint door-to-door, seeking shelter as he lost a massive amount of blood. A stranger took him in, and medics rushed him to the hospital. Other residents who didn't hear him woke up to find blood on their porches. Blood still stained the roads at Creighton and Wyalusing later in the day. "Blood on my steps, my porch, my doorknob. It seems like he must have knocked on my door, one of the victims knocked on my door, tried to get in or something," said one neighbor, too fearful to show his face or give us his name. Police interviewed multiple witnesses overnight, including the person who let the wounded teen in their home. They have released the following descriptions of the two suspects: #1: Light-skinned black male, mid-20s #2: Dark-skinned black female, 5'10", wearing a black leather coat and blue-and-white leggings, carrying a yellow and black book bag.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":956,"startIndex":941,"value":"like 5 gunshots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":32,"startIndex":14,"value":" West Philadelphia"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":446,"startIndex":424,"value":" just after 10:30 p.m."},"date":"2015-12-13","details":{"endIndex":557,"startIndex":502,"value":"500 block of North Creighton Street at Wyalusing Avenue"},"state":"PA - Pennsylvania","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1893,"startIndex":1885,"value":" mid-20s"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1879,"startIndex":1874,"value":"black"}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1916,"startIndex":1911,"value":"black"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":228,"startIndex":226,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":251,"startIndex":238,"value":"Dashon Glover"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":362,"startIndex":358,"value":"teen"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1GIKPKZ2EUB19

The chase began around 2:40 a.m. at the diner on the 500 block of State Fair Boulevard after officers responding to reports of shots being fired saw a car leave the scene at a "high rate of speed" and get onto westbound Route 690. Police pursued the suspect on 690 and were finally able to stop the car on Route 48 in Lysander with help from the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office, according to the Syracuse Police Department.

Monday) ROCKBRIDGE CO., Va., - Federal, state and local law enforcement are continuing their search efforts in Rockbridge County Monday for a male subject who shot at a deputy shortly after midnight Saturday (Dec. 5). Rockbridge County residents are advised to remain alert and report any suspicious activity to the sheriff’s office by dialing 911. The public can also contact state police on a cell at #77 or by calling 1-800-542-5959 or by email at questions@vsp.virginia.gov. Shortly after midnight Saturday morning, a Rockbridge County Sheriff’s Deputy attempted to stop a vehicle for speeding on Route 60 in the county. The deputy activated his emergency lights and the vehicle’s driver, William Evan Hall, 35, pulled over and stopped. During the course of the traffic stop, Hall fired at the deputy at least two times. The deputy’s vehicle was struck. Fortunately, the deputy was not injured. Hall then sped away from the scene. A pursuit was initiated by the deputy, but was discontinued when the responding deputies lost sight of Hall’s vehicle. The sheriff’s office later located Hall’s abandoned vehicle. During the course of the investigation, Rockbridge County deputies responded to a call of a break-in at a residence in the 100 block of Bennetts Run Road that occurred at approximately 6:45 a.m., Saturday (Dec. 5). Evidence at the scene indicates Hall stole clothing and a firearm from the residence. Hall is a white male, 6’1 tall and weighing approximately 175 pounds. The 35-year-old has a muscular build, buzz cut, and numerous tattoos. He is from Abingdon, Va., but has been living in the Lynchburg and Roanoke areas for the last several weeks. Hall is considered armed and dangerous, and should not be approached.

3413	http://fox47.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/investigators-id-two-civilians-killed-planned-parenthood-shooting-6958.shtml	WMSN FOX 47 :: Newsroom - Top Stories - Investigators ID two civilians killed in Planned Parenthood shooting	WMSN FOX 47 :: Newsroom - Top Stories - Investigators ID two civilians killed in Planned Parenthood shooting(CNN) - Jennifer Markovsky, 35, and Ke'Arre Marcell Stewart, 29, were the two civilians killed in Friday's Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado Springs, Colorado, officials said Sunday. What moved a man to kill three people and wound nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado has not been disclosed. But the suspect accused of carrying out the shooting spree, Robert Lewis Dear, made remarks about "baby parts" to investigators after his surrender, a law enforcement official told CNN. Dear, 57, told them he has anti-abortion and anti-government views, but that doesn't mean those opinions were his motive for allegedly shooting up the Colorado Springs clinic on Friday, the official said. It's too early to tell, as investigators are still processing evidence. After a nearly six-hour bloody standoff that left three people dead and nine others wounded, the accused shooter dropped his gun when a SWAT team drove up in an armored police vehicle, a BearCat, and cornered him, the official said. Law enforcement officers found propane tanks in the area of Dear's car in the parking lot and believe he was trying to shoot them to cause an explosion, the official said. 'Crime against women' In the absence of an announced motive, public officials in Colorado and beyond are drawing their own conclusions about the attack. It was a "crime against women receiving health care services," said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She pledged the full resources of her office to investigate. "You can certainly infer what (the motive) may have been in terms of where it took place and the manner in which it took place," Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers told CNN. Vicki Cowart, president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, went beyond an inference, saying the shooter "was motivated by opposition to safe and legal abortion." A hermit's shanty Dear is being held without bail in a Colorado Springs jail, according to the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. He is due to appear in court Monday afternoon. Shown in police photos with dark hair and a fluffy white beard, the suspect appears to have lived a long time in rural solitude in the Carolinas, then more recently in Colorado. Over a decade ago, he had some run-ins with the law while living in South Carolina but was never convicted. In 1997, Dear's wife accused him of domestic assault, although no charges were pressed, according to records from the Colleton County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina. In 2002, Dear was charged with being a peeping Tom; those counts were dismissed. In 2003, he was arrested and charged with two counts of animal cruelty, but he was found not guilty in a bench trial. He later made his home in a hermit shanty in the mountains of North Carolina, CNN affiliate WLOS reported. It published a photo of a small, basic cabin in the woods of Buncombe County. The Sheriff's Office there knew Dear from a single civil citation issued in 2014 for allowing his dogs to run wild. About a year ago, Dear chose the crossroads community of Hartsel, Colorado, as his home, according to public records. It is nestled in grassy plains and rolling foothills framed by Rocky Mountain ranges and is about an hour and 20 minutes' drive from Colorado Springs. Dear bought a spread -- 65 miles west of the Planned Parenthood clinic -- for $6,000. Zigmond Post, a neighbor, said Dear brought him some anti-Obama pamphlets once. "That's about all I've run into him," he said. It's safe to say that few people knew who Dear was until he walked out of the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood after allegedly shooting 12 people and terrorizing many others. Conversations captured over the police scanner gave glimpses into the drama inside the clinic as well as the strategic debate about how to stop the suspect and get his hostages to safety at the same time. Joan Motolinia's sister was among those inside. She called him Friday afternoon, and he could hear the shooting in the background, he said. "She couldn't say much because she was afraid," Motolinia said, tearing up as he recounted the call. Officer Garrett Swasey died along with two civilian victims in the hail of bullets. He was an elder in his church and a former figure skating artist. Swasey was a University of Colorado-Colorado Springs officer who rushed to the clinic to offer his assistance. "There was no way any of us could have kept him here," said UCCS Police Chief Brian McPike. "He was always willing to go. ... He had an enthusiasm that was hard to quell." The Melrose, Massachusetts, native "found his calling as a police officer," according to a statement from his family. "Helping others brought him deep satisfaction and being a police officer was a part of him. In the end, his last act was for the safety and well-being of others and was a tribute to his life," it said. As of early Sunday afternoon, a fundraising page set up for Swasey's wife of 17 years, Rachel, and his two children -- Elijah, 10 and Faith, 6 -- had reached more than $70,000 of a stated goal of $100,000. Ke'Arre Stewart was also killed in the shooting, according to a friend of the victim. Stewart's wife said he leaves behind children, and that his family is seeking justice, CNN affiliate KKTV reported. The other civilian victim has not yet been identified. Obama: 'Enough is enough' In a statement on Saturday, President Barack Obama offered praise for Swasey, condolences to the families of the victims and condemnation of the attack as another example of gun violence. "This is not normal. We can't let it become normal," Obama said. "If we truly care about this -- if we're going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience -- then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them. "Period. Enough is enough." Planned Parenthood has recently endured intense political and social opposition. Eight undercover videos released over the summer by anti-abortion activists have stirred caustic criticism against the reproductive health clinic. The controversy has reached the halls of Congress, where conservative politicians have demanded the group's defunding. Planned Parenthood has said the videos, which alleged illegal fetal organ sales, were heavily edited and inaccurate. At least three of the organization's buildings have been vandalized since September, not long after the last video appeared. Copyright 2015 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

The Ramsey County jury ruled Wednesday on the Dec. 17 incident involving the death of Johnathan Dean Mar, 18, of Kennewick, Wash. Hennepin County sheriff's deputy Matthew Hagen and Brooklyn Center police officer Alan Salvosa were cleared by the grand jury of any criminal conduct in the shooting. Police began pursuing Mar after they were called to the scene of an apparent shooting at the Elm Creek rest stop on Interstate 94 in Maple Grove. There they found 23-year-old Matthew Paul Maffei dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Maffei also had ties to the Kennewick area. A witness reportedly helped officers spot an SUV matching the description of one seen fleeing the rest stop; police from several agencies pursued the vehicle until it crashed into the wire median on Interstate 694 near Rice Street in Shoreview. Investigators with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension determined that Mar repeatedly stabbed himself after emerging from his crashed vehicle. He then charged at the officers with a knife. Mar died of multiple gunshot wounds.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-17","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MN - Minnesota","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":376,"startIndex":374,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":372,"startIndex":354,"value":"Johnathan Dean Mar"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CA46R2A6TV9W

A MPD public information officer tells DCist that the incident occurred at approximately 12:15 p.m. in the 2400 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard SE. A store owner who was just robbed at gunpoint flagged down officers, who subsequently spotted the suspects in a vehicle and followed. When the suspects became stuck in traffic, they exited the vehicle and fled on foot. The officers pursued, at which point one of the suspects brandished a gun toward one of the officers who discharged his weapon. The officer hit an innocent bystander instead of the suspect, the public information officer said. The victim was transported to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries. Police arrested the three robbery suspects and an investigation into the incident is ongoing.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":329,"startIndex":319,"value":"12:15 p.m."},"date":"2016-01-07","details":{"endIndex":382,"startIndex":337,"value":"2400 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard SE"},"state":"DC - District of Columbia","time-day":{"endIndex":207,"startIndex":198,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1FGKIKJYSL1MI

(December 22, 2015) — Metro Police say they’re searching for two suspects who fired shots at officers during a chase on the southeast side. No one was hurt, but police say one bullet hit a squad car while another bullet hit a near-by apartment, just narrowly missing a young child inside. The chase started around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday after officers were called to to the 2500 block of Appleton Terrace on a report of a man with a gun. When they got there, police say the suspect took-off, eventually speeding into a residential apartment complex and through a grassy knoll in the 1500 block of Renton Street. Police say, when officers cornered the suspects, a driver and passenger began firing shots at officers through the back windshield of the car, then continued to shoot as they both ran away on foot. Police say it’s not clear if one person or both suspects were firing a weapon. IMPD spokesperson Officer Chris Wilburn says they believe about nine rounds were fired towards officers. “They fired at police and that’s where the problem begins,” Wilburn said. “Nine officers have been fatally shot this year alone and we still haven’t gotten to the end of this year,” he said. “We face people who are violent. We are some of the most highly trained police officers in the state. But this is really, really serious that we have individuals firing at an officers,” Wilburn said. Wilburn says officers drew their weapons but did not fire back because they didn’t have a clear shot with the apartments near-by. IMPD SWAT, K-9 and Tactical Air units searched for the suspects all Tuesday night. The perimeter was released after an extensive search. The suspect’s car was processed by the Marion County Forensic Service Agency. No word on any suspect descriptions at this time.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":89,"startIndex":77,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":419,"startIndex":410,"value":"8:30 p.m."},"date":"2015-12-22","details":{"endIndex":495,"startIndex":465,"value":"2500 block of Appleton Terrace"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":419,"startIndex":415,"value":"p.m."}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A3N85HRT1FLBS8

The victim was the stepdaughter of a long time undercover drug officer and the mother works as a dispatcher for Osceola County. Campbell can be heard in the audio telling the dispatcher that Ashley Doby has “passed out. She has a pacemaker. She has a heart problem,” in the recording released by police. However, Campbell failed to mention the gunshot wound to Doby’s chest, but police said he was asleep when his wife shot her daughter and didn’t’ realize what happened. The 27-year-old was transported n to a local hospital where she later died. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Doby’s death is being characterized by St. Cloud Police as an “accidental shooting,” Sherry Campbell, 45, fired one fatal shot which struck her daughter’s chest. She has not been arrested on any criminal charges and has admitted that she shot her daughter. “The homeowner’s story is consistent with the physical evidence and the witness’ statement,” Sgt. Denise Roberts said. “At this time, the incident appears to be an accidental shooting; however, the investigation is ongoing…” Once the investigation is complete, the case will be forwarded to the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s Office to decide whether or not to file criminal charges.

3786	http://fox59.com/2015/12/07/armed-suspects-kick-in-door-hold-residents-at-gunpoint-in-indianapolis-home-invasion/	4-year-old girl held at gunpoint during home robbery | Fox 59	4-year-old girl held at gunpoint during home robbery | Fox 59INDIANAPOLIS (Dec 7, 2015) - Indianapolis Metropolitan Police are searching for three armed suspects who broke into a west side home and held a 4-year-old girl and her father at gunpoint Sunday night. Police responded to a 911 call just after 10 p.m. Sunday in the 2100 block of White Avenue. It is believed a neighbor made the call after seeing three suspects kicking in a door to force their way into a house. When police arrived at the robbery location, a 30-year-old man told officers he was in a back room when he heard a loud boom coming from the front of the house. He said he heard several males shouting “police” as they entered the home. The man said he was holding his daughter in his arms when he stepped out into a hallway and came face-to-face with the intruders. The victim told police the three suspects were armed with handguns. He described the three black males as being 18 to 21 years of age, about 5’8’’ to 6’0’’ tall. The victim noticed one of the suspects was wearing True Religion brand jeans. The victim said he was holding his daughter as the suspects pointed their guns at him, saying “we will shoot you if we don’t find cash.” “Any time they pointed that gun at him, they could have struck the little child,” said IMPD Officer Chris Wilburn. The victim said the suspects rooted through the house, grabbing $200 cash from his pocket, a pair of True Religion jeans, and an Xbox One gaming system. But the 911 call from the neighbor apparently cut the robbery short. The suspects quickly ran out the backdoor when they heard police arriving outside. “This crime was thwarted because law enforcement were alerted very soon and began the process of arriving in an expedited fashion,” Wilburn said. Barbara Gold, who lives nearby said she and other neighbors look out for each other. She said she spoke to the robbery victim a short time after the break in. “He said he didn’t know who called them (police), but whoever called them, he thinks they might have saved his life,” Gold said. Gold also said the 4-year-old girl appeared terrified a couple hours after the robbery. Police found a stolen car in the alley behind the house. The car had been reported stolen to Lawrence Police on December 1. The robbery suspects presumably left the car behind when they ran out the back of the house. The car and two cell phones found inside it could prove useful in the investigation. The victim’s cell phone was also found in a nearby field, apparently dropped by one of the suspects running away from the house. Police records indicate the robbery victim has his own history with police. Prior arrests dating back several years include drug dealing and possession, illegal possession of a firearm and multiple traffic arrests. Police could not say Tuesday if that history made the victim a target for the robbery, but it is part of the ongoing investigation. Anyone with information that could help the investigation is asked to call IMPD or Crime Stoppers at (317) 262-TIPS.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":905,"startIndex":897,"value":"handguns"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":73,"startIndex":61,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":311,"startIndex":304,"value":"10 p.m."},"date":"2015-12-06","details":{"endIndex":352,"startIndex":326,"value":"2100 block of White Avenue"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":260,"startIndex":255,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":959,"startIndex":951,"value":"18 to 21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":935,"startIndex":930,"value":"black"}},{"age":{"endIndex":959,"startIndex":950,"value":" 18 to 21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":935,"startIndex":930,"value":"black"}},{"age":{"endIndex":959,"startIndex":951,"value":"18 to 21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":935,"startIndex":930,"value":"black"}}],"victim-section":[]}	AAF8WL2MYB9P

Investigators say the two men went into the home on Taft Court near Belleview and Simms and tied up the male homeowner. He got loose, ran out and began firing at Martinez, 38, who was driving away in his SUV. Mascarenas got away. While the search continues for the accomplice the district attorney will decide if the homeowner should be charged for shooting and killing the suspected intruder. Investigators were trying to determine whether the same suspects were wanted in another attempted robbery the day before.

He was wounded in the head and shoulder when another driver fired six rounds into his vehicle. Police said Reavis had been following a pickup driven by Austin Burch, 27, of North Augusta, about 11:20 p.m. Burch stated Reavis continually tried to run him off the road and hit his vehicle twice. Fearing for his life, Burch fired into the truck. A hospital spokeswoman said Reavis was not listed in the patient directory, but that doesn’t mean he might not be a patient there. Lt. Allan Rollins confirmed Wednesday he remains hospitalized. His updated condition was not released. A preliminary investigation determined Burch was justified in the shooting and will not face charges. The same might not be true for Reavis. He was being assaulted by a nut in a 2 or 3 thousand pound motor vehicle! That's right pull over so he can get a good shot at t-boning you through your door and killing you. Too bad he didn't receive a fatal bullet. But he'll live to do it to you or one of your family members next time.

Dallas police have arrested a suspect in a deadly domestic shooting Sunday in South Dallas. Ervin Ray Pickens, 61, faces a murder charge in the death of 54-year-old Gregory Bishop, according to police. The shooting happened about 6:15 p.m. when Bishop came to a home on Southland Street demanding to see his 9-month-old child. The woman living there with Pickens and the child refused, saying Bishop was drunk and needed to leave, according to police records. It’s unclear how she and the victim were related. Pickens then retrieved a shotgun from the house, while the woman took the baby inside. Pickens told police he shot Bishop as he tried to push his way into the home. “I told him not to come over here and I shot him,” Pickens told officers, according to his arrest warrant affidavit. Bishop was taken to Baylor University Medical Center where he died.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":732,"startIndex":725,"value":"shotgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":77,"startIndex":71,"value":"Dallas"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":429,"startIndex":420,"value":"6:15 p.m."},"date":"2015-12-27","details":{"endIndex":476,"startIndex":460,"value":"Southland Street"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":303,"startIndex":301,"value":"61"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":299,"startIndex":282,"value":"Ervin Ray Pickens"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":345,"startIndex":343,"value":"54"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":369,"startIndex":355,"value":"Gregory Bishop"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A138BU1VWM2RKN

(Jan. 8, 2016)—The four suspects apprehended following an officer-involved shooting have been identified by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Friday. Kaleb Farris, 19; Joseph Shibli, 19; Dakota Williams, 19; and Nicholas Bollinger, 18, were taken into custody following the incident Thursday evening. Officers responded to the abandoned building near an old power plant building at Vermont Street and Tibbs Avenue just before 6 p.m. after suspicious behavior was reported. When they arrived, they found the door to the vacant power plant was damaged and heard voices coming from inside the building. Police say the officers entered the dark building and were confronted by an armed suspect, displaying a weapon, which was later determined to be an airsoft gun. Police say the suspect fired the airsoft gun at the officer, and the officer returned one shot, but the suspect was not struck. Officers recovered three airsoft guns from three of the suspects, who were immediately taken into custody. Bollinger fled the scene, but he was apprehended a short time later. Police say the four trespassed into the building to play an airsoft tag game. The suspects told officers they were planning to capture video on their cell phones of the game and upload the video to YouTube. The four suspects were released. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office is reviewing the case to determine if charges will be filed.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":117,"startIndex":105,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":570,"startIndex":563,"value":" 6 p.m."},"date":"2016-01-08","details":{"endIndex":551,"startIndex":519,"value":" Vermont Street and Tibbs Avenue"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A17F4I34PD4JZS

The full, nine-page lawsuit submitted by Officer Robert Rialmo and his lawyer, obtained by the Times, provides a detailed account of what happened on Dec. 26, the night Rialmo fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and LeGrier’s neighbor Bettie Jones, 55. That account is hotly contested, though. A lawyer for LeGrier’s estate, Basileios J. Foutris, told the Times that the suit was “pure fantasy.” Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, didn’t contest the facts of the suit specifically, but said that “the city does not support” the lawsuit “and is not involved in any way.” According to the suit, Rialmo arrived at LeGrier’s address at roughly 4:20 a.m. on the morning of the shooting. He “rang the doorbell and knocked on the front door”-this is the level of detail in the document—and Jones let him in. She allegedly told him “It’s upstairs,” and returned to her first-floor apartment. Soon after, the suit alleges that LeGrier emerged from his second-story apartment holding a baseball bat, and came down the stairs to the entryway where Officer Rialmo was standing. According to the suit, while the two were roughly four feet apart: LeGrier placed his left hand on the baseball bat which he was holding in his right hand, cocked the baseball bat back over his right shoulder, and took a full swing at Officer RIalmo’s head, missing it by inches, but getting close enough for Officer Rialmo to feel the movement of air as the bat passed in front of his face. The suit alleges that LeGrier refused Rialmo’s orders to drop the bat, and swung the bat at Rialmo a total of four times as Rialmo backed away. After LeGrier’s fourth swing, the suit alleges, Rialmo began to shoot at LeGrier. One shot, according to the suit’s account, passed through LeGrier’s left arm and hit Jones, who was standing out of Rialmo’s field of vision in the building’s doorway. One of the final items of the suit argues that LeGrier’s behavior has caused Rialmo “extreme emotional trauma.” The document also cites Rialmo’s “pain and suffering,” “damage to person,” and unspecified “medical expenses” as reasons for the lawsuit. Previously, we knew this lawsuit existed, but the public only understood the bare bones of the shooting incident: Officers arrived at LeGrier’s home in response to 911 calls about a domestic disturbance. (LeGrier himself called 911 three times that night, but was repeatedly hung up on by 911 operators; officials responded to a call from LeGrier’s father, Antonio.) On the scene, Rialmo fatally shot LeGrier, who police termed “combative” and whose autopsy revealed a bullet wound in his back. Rialmo also “accidentally struck and tragically killed” Jones, according to the initial police statement. The public consensus has been that LeGrier was killed in the midst of a mental health crisis, and the city has since revamped its policies for protocols for police interacting with mentally ill civilians.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":8,"oldEnd":8,"oldStart":-4,"startIndex":-4,"value":"2016Chicago "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1008,"startIndex":999,"value":"4:20 a.m."},"date":"2015-12-26","details":{"endIndex":1389,"startIndex":1380,"value":" entryway"},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":406,"startIndex":393,"value":"Robert Rialmo"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":554,"startIndex":552,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":550,"startIndex":533,"value":"Quintonio LeGrier"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":595,"startIndex":593,"value":"55"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":591,"startIndex":579,"value":"Bettie Jones"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AI4J8TH0Y11X5

Cleveland police said he went to a hospital in Erie to get treatment for a gunshot wound. Cleveland Heights police said they were in the area of E. 79th and Woodland Ave. in Cleveland just after 1 p.m. Monday when undercover detectives spotted a car in a parking lot that matched the description of a robbery suspect's vehicle. Police said the suspect took off speeding, then ran from the vehicle towards Kinsman past officers who were pursuing him. According to Cleveland Heights police, the suspect was carrying a handgun, believed to be a semi-automatic, which he allegedly pointed at the officers. He then, according to police, went up to a driver stopped in traffic and tried to remove her from the car at gunpoint, but was unsuccessful. He then ran up to another vehicle and removed that woman from her car at gunpoint. Police said he then took off in that car, pointing the gun at police; officers discharged their weapons at the suspect. Minutes later, the suspect is accused of carjacking another person, this time on Euclid Ave, and taking off in the car. The Cleveland Division of Police Use of Deadly Force Investigation Team is investigating the officer-involved shooting. No officers were injured and no Cleveland police officers were involved in the incident. Police said the suspect was considered armed and dangerous and asked that no one approach him. Once again, he was taken into custody.

Police say a man was shot and killed near 6th and Wright late Sunday, January 3rd. It happened around 11:05 p.m. Police say a man, identified as 45-year-old Deondrick Byrd, was shot and pronounced dead at the scene. "It`s sad though -- very sad," Janackery Winston, who was friends with the victim said. With tears in his eyes, the victim's brother looked for clues at the scene of the crime on Monday. A camera located at the corner of 6th and Wright may have some clues as to who killed the victim and why. For now, those who knew and loved the man are trying to deal with their loss. "He had a lot of love out here. He was an outstanding person. He had a good heart," Winston said. "I can`t see how somebody can have hate in her hearts where they can just take someone else's life," Jerryrome Johnnies said. Johnnies works at the community center at the corner of 6th and Wright. As someone who tries to empower those in Milwaukee, he's disheartened to see this deadly violence. "It`s sad that somebody would have to die in the same place, and be the first homicide of the new year in the same spot where somebody else got killed," Johnnies said. A memorial for a recent shooting victim still sits at the scene of this first homicide of 2016. Just last week, Johnnies and others held a vigil for the 145 people who lost their lives to violence in Milwaukee in 2015. "We had a memorial for all the people that died in Milwaukee. Tried to give a shoutout to the people that died last year so there won`t have to be that many this year," Johnnies said. "People need to have an open heart. If you know how another person would feel losing a loved one, maybe people wouldn`t be killing each other so quickly out here." The circumstances surrounding this homicide remain unclear at this time. Milwaukee police continue to seek a motive and search for suspect(s).	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-03","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"WI - Wisconsin","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A25TXMQS96HOBS

4001	http://citizensvoice.com/news/da-man-shot-by-state-police-was-armed-with-three-rifles-1.1987147	DA: Man shot by state police was armed with three rifles - News - Citizens' Voice	DA: Man shot by state police was armed with three rifles - News - Citizens' VoiceHONESDALE — A 21-year-old man shot and killed by state police Monday carried a rifle in his arms and had two other rifles slung across his shoulders when he turned to face three state troopers who responded to his Canaan Township home, authorities said. Derek DeGroat didn’t comply with the state troopers’ commands to drop his weapons and stop walking, said Wayne County District Attorney Janine Edwards at a Wednesday press conference. The state troopers yelled the command more than 10 times. “He refused,” Edwards said in prepared remarks. “Over and over they yelled to him to stop walking. He continued to refuse.” More details on the deadly incident emerged Wednesday during the press conference at the county courthouse in Honesdale. However, the names of the three state troopers who shot DeGroat were not released. The three have not been interviewed by investigators and won’t be interviewed until 72 hours after the incident, which is state police protocol, authorities said. “They’ve been debriefed on what to expect physically and psychologically ... to put them in the best possible position to move the investigation forward,” said state police Capt. Christopher Paris, commander of Troop R, which oversees the barracks in Honesdale, among others in the region. Several state troopers who were at the scene but not involved in the shooting were interviewed, Edwards said. State police responded to 9 Volunteer Way on Monday after a 10:36 p.m. call to 911 placed by DeGroat’s sister, Breanna DeGroat. She said her brother had a gun and threatened to kill himself. The call disconnected. A state police dispatcher reconnected the call and spoke with DeGroat’s mother, Sheila DeGroat. She reiterated what her daughter said and the phone moved to DeGroat’s girlfriend, Lindsey Erk. Erk told the dispatcher her boyfriend armed himself with three guns and said “if you call 911 I’m going to shoot them,” implying the police, Edwards said. Erk later told investigators she and her boyfriend had been at a party that night and DeGroat gets mean when he drinks. They argued throughout the night. He armed himself with a rifle when they arrived at the home on Volunteer Way. Erk tried to take the gun from him and she cut her hand. Sirens approached. DeGroat emerged from the home armed with three rifles, a machete and a hatchet, she told investigators. Erk went to a neighbor’s driveway and hid with DeGroat’s mother behind a parked vehicle. State police vehicles arrived at the home. They flooded the area with light and watched as an armed DeGroat walked from a tree in the lawn toward the house, Edwards said. The state troopers shouted at him to stop. He moved the rifle around the front of his body. Gun in hand, he turned and faced the three state troopers. The three opened fire. “Mr. DeGroat fell to the ground,” Edwards said. The state troopers approached him, began CPR, applied pressure to his wounds and spoke with him until an ambulance arrived. County Coroner Edward Howell pronounced the 21-year-old dead at 11:53 p.m. “I intend to do a thorough and professional investigation in this matter,” Edwards said. It’s unknown how many times state police shot MDeGroat or if the rifles he carried were loaded. The three state troopers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol. “We’re working very diligently,” Paris said. “Many of us up here have not slept and there are many others who have not slept very much over the last 36 hours. ...We want to bring this investigation to a close and were doing everything we can to do that.” jkohut@timesshamrock.com, @jkohutTT	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":90,"startIndex":81,"value":"HONESDALE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1539,"oldEnd":1538,"oldStart":1527,"startIndex":1528,"value":"10:36 p.m. "},"date":"2015-12-24","details":{"endIndex":315,"startIndex":291,"value":"his Canaan Township home"},"state":"PA - Pennsylvania","time-day":{"endIndex":2181,"startIndex":2176,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":97,"startIndex":95,"value":"21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9

The incident unfolded around 9:30 p.m. Thursday in the area of Gratiot and State Fair Avenue. Police have not yet released the victim’s name, but he was identified by family members as 33-year-old Anthony Tolson — a renowned bass player who has toured with artists such as Ne-Yo, Young Jeezy and Kelis. Tolson, of Eastpointe, had just finished playing bass during service at Central Baptist Church in Detroit. His SUV was full of presents and he was headed to his mother’s home, where his three children were staying. But Tolson ran into trouble on the way and he never made it. Police say he was forced out of his SUV by two suspects. Shots were fired and the suspects then fled the scene in Tolson’s vehicle. He was left in the street to die. Other circumstances surrounding the incident remain unclear. Police have not yet indicated if this crime was random or if Tolson was targeted. His SUV has not yet been recovered. An investigation is ongoing.

Police were responding to a report of an assault in progress when the shooting took place at approximately 1:25 p.m. in the 1000 block of West 103rd Place, police said. One person was transported in critical condition to Advocate Christ Hospital, according to the Chicago Fire Department. Family identified him as 24-year-old Mekel Lumpkin. As of Sunday morning, Lumpkin remains hospitalized in stable condition. Police say that a weapon has been recovered. No officers were injured. The family says Mekel was arguing with his brother and that he had a gun but put it down when police arrived. They say Mekel was shot five times. A source with knowledge of the investigation says police arrived in the scene and saw the suspect firing into a building and ordered him to drop the weapon. When he didn’t, he was shot. Independent Police Review Authority Chief Administrator Sharon Fairley says she understands people are anxious for answers, but asks for patience. “At this time, it would be inappropriate for me to answer any questions or provide any further comment on the details of what happened,” Fairley said. The shooting in Washington Heights is the second police-involved shooting Saturday. Earlier, a man and woman were shot to death by Chicago Police responding to a domestic disturbance in the Austin neighborhood.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":792,"startIndex":783,"value":" five tim"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":92,"startIndex":83,"value":" Chicago "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":281,"startIndex":273,"value":"1:25 p.m"},"date":"2015-12-26","details":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":290,"value":"1000 block of West 103rd Place"},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":492,"startIndex":480,"value":"24-year-old "},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":505,"startIndex":492,"value":"Mekel Lumpkin"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	APDHGWINATRUC

The victim, a man in his 20s, arrived at a Pasadena hospital about 3 p.m. Thursday, Pasadena police Lt. Jesse Carrillo said. He was suffering from a gunshot wound to his abdomen and was listed in critical but stable condition. “Hospital staff notified us of the victim and officers responded,” the lieutenant said. “Based on the preliminary statement, it appears the incident occurred in the area of Raymond Avenue and Montana Street.” Officers canvassed the neighborhood in search of clues, detaining several people in the area for questioning, Lt. Diego Torres said. Detectives ultimately determined Jesus Javier Miron, 19, of Pasadena, who was found on foot in the area, was the alleged gunman, Torres said. The motive and circumstances of the shooting remained under investigation Friday, police said. It was unclear whether the victim and suspect knew one another prior to the shooting. Miron was booked on suspicion of attempted murder, Torres said. According to Los Angeles County booking records, he was being held in lieu of $1 million bail pending his initial court appearance. Police also arrested a second man, Gabriel Del Rio Solorio, who was accompanying the victim at the hospital, on suspicion of possessing brass knuckles, Torres said. The 24-year-old Pasadena man was released from custody Friday afternoon pending his initial court appearance after posting $20,000 bail, records show. Thursday’s shooting was the seventh in Pasadena in three weeks. Police and city officials plan to host a meeting Wednesday to discuss the recent spate of violence, which began Dec. 18 with the fatal shooting of 27-year-old Robert Arthur Calderon of Altadena. The following day, a woman was wounded in a shooting during a gathering to memorialize Calderon. Four out of the six shooting that preceded Thursday’s incident were gang-related, according to Cmdr. John Perez. Investigators had yet to determine whether Thursday’s shooting was gang-related.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":77,"startIndex":69,"value":"PASADENA"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":315,"value":"3 p.m"},"date":"2016-01-07","details":{"endIndex":681,"startIndex":648,"value":"Raymond Avenue and Montana Street"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":233,"startIndex":224,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":872,"startIndex":870,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":868,"startIndex":850,"value":"Jesus Javier Miron"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":276,"startIndex":273,"value":"20s"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2J5T37QADQGAE

(Jan. 20, 2016) -- Murder charges are filed against three suspects, including two teenagers, after a Cumberland convenience store clerk was shot to death. The two teens will be charged as adults for their alleged involvement in the fatal shooting. According to court records, the victim died of a single gunshot to the heart. Several witnesses helped identify the three suspects. Two of those witnesses gave FOX59 an exclusive interview about the horrifying ordeal. The deadly violence started Friday night at the Cumberland Express Mart, where two armed suspects wearing masks and hoodies stormed inside. “They swung the doors open and whipped out their guns and said, ‘We’re robbing this place. Give us the money,’” said one witness who asked not to be identified. Prosecutors now say Tyler Miller and Damion Cobb, both 17, committed the robbery. One of the suspects then shot and killed the clerk Monte Singh with virtually no warning. The two witnesses inside the store at the time could only watch in horror. “I don’t know why they shot Monte and didn’t give him a chance,” said the first witness. “I don’t know why they didn’t shoot me.” “By the time the cops got there he was gone,” said the second witness. “He died in my arms and on my lap.” Just minutes later, prosecutors say the same suspects robbed a second convenience store and pistol whipped the clerk. After both robberies, the suspects sped away in a white Dodge. Prosecutors believe 23-year-old Kiree Hayes drove the getaway car, which crashed into a ditch after the second stickup. All three suspects were arrested while walking away from the area. According to the affidavit, the two teenage suspects refused to talk to police, but Hayes did and denied any involvement in the robberies. He did admit to crashing the white Dodge. The two witnesses still struggle to make sense of the slaying, but they hope the suspects spend the rest of their lives behind bars. “They ruined their lives for nothing because they didn’t even get what they came to do, so it kind of feels pointless,” said one of the witness. One of the teenage suspects is being held on an $80,000 bond. The second has a $40,000 bond. The third suspect is set to make to be in court on Friday.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":414,"startIndex":408,"value":"single"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":104,"startIndex":94,"value":"CUMBERLAND"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-15","details":{"endIndex":648,"startIndex":625,"value":"Cumberland Express Mart"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":617,"startIndex":612,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":935,"startIndex":933,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":910,"startIndex":898,"value":"Tyler Miller"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":935,"startIndex":933,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":926,"startIndex":915,"value":"Damion Cobb"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1022,"startIndex":1011,"value":"Monte Singh"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3H48TMCITL94X

4131	http://deadline.com/2016/01/hollywood-gun-deaths-history-list-1201677825/	Covering Celebrity Gun Deaths: Hollywood’s Own Killing Fields | Deadline	Covering Celebrity Gun Deaths: Hollywood’s Own Killing Fields | DeadlinePresident Barack Obama’s call to action to stem the tide of gun violence has particular relevance to Hollywood. While there are industry conservatives who disagree with the president’s call for increased background checks and vetting measures, and liberals who will feel the president hasn’t gone far enough, there is also a long trail of industry insiders and their loved ones lost to gun violence. I have had the grim task of reporting many of these over the last quarter-century, and when I sat down and contemplated the carnage in the wake of the president’s appeal Monday, I was taken aback at how long the list actually is. In 1989, when 21-year-old My Sister Sam star Rebecca Schaeffer was gunned down in her doorway by a deranged fan, the Screen Actors Guild spearheaded a campaign to make it more difficult for stalkers to obtain the home addresses of celebrities. Her killer had obtained her address in the Fairfax District through a private detective, who got it from the Department of Motor Vehicles. It was the first celebrity shooting death I covered as a reporter, but it would not be the last. Today, largely thanks to SAG’s efforts, it’s no longer legal for the DMV to give out celebrities’ home addresses to anyone. But SAG has no jurisdiction over how easy it is for troubled potential killers to get their hands on guns. Schaeffer’s killer, who at the time was too young to buy a gun legally, got the .357 Magnum he shot her with from his brother, who had purchased it legally in Arizona. Six years later, I covered the shooting death of Selena, the popular singer who was murdered in a hotel room in Texas by the president of her fan club, who had legally purchased the .38 revolver used in the crime. The killer didn’t need Selena’s home address – just easy access to a gun. In 1996, I covered the murder of actor Haing Ngor, who survived the real-life killing fields of Cambodia and then went on to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in The Killing Fields, only to be gunned down outside his home in Los Angeles by a local street gang. The murder weapon never was located. A year later, I covered the murder-suicide of MPAA general counsel William J. Billick III, who chased his wife out of their home, and then went back inside and shot their 18-month-old twins, Daniel and Alexandra. Then he turned his legally purchased handgun on himself. The funeral was as sad as any I ever covered. In 1998, I covered the shooting death of actor, comedian and Saturday Night Live stalwart Phil Hartman. He was killed by his wife, Brynn. She too had legally purchased the murder weapon – one of several she’d bought for home protection. After killing her husband, she shot herself. Many others in the industry have been killed by gunfire — most famously, singer-songwriter John Lennon in 1980. He was shot multiple times by a stalker with a gun that had been legally purchased in Hawaii. Others to meet a similar fate include: Many family members of celebrities have also been killed by guns. Bill Cosby’s 27-year-old son Ennis was shot to death in 1997, while fixing a flat tire just off the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles. It remains unclear how his killer, an 18-year-old Ukrainian immigrant, obtained the weapon. Cheers and Frasier star Kelsey Grammer’s father was shot to death in 1968. In 1986, Dallas star Patrick Duffy’s mother and father were shotgunned to death during a robbery of the bar they owned in Montana. Mark Ruffalo’s brother, Scott, was shot to death in 2008 during what police described as a game of Russian roulette. In 2011, The Apprentice star Omarosa Manigault’s brother was shot to death in Ohio by his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend. When Allman Brothers founders Gregg and Duane Allman were little, their father was shot to death by a hitchhiker. When Sean Combs was only 3, his father also was shot to death. Basketball great Michael Jordan’s father, James Jordan Sr., was shot to death in 1993. Singer Marvin Gaye was shot to death by his own father, in 1984. Ice Cube’s sister, Beverly Jean Brown, was shot to death by her husband in South Central Los Angeles in 1981. “America is built on the gun,” the rapper and Straight Outta Compton producer later said. “America is in love with the gun. It’s a sick love affair. But it’s just hard to break.” No doubt, there will be more celebrity shooting deaths to cover in the days ahead. Like Ice Cube said, America is in love with the gun, and Hollywood is not immune to its tragic effects.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-07","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Yes","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Milwaukee police believe it's all related and it leaves one man murdered by gunfire. The series of events began around 12:13 a.m. Thursday morning, when officers responded to a report of shots fired near 6th and Meinecke. Police say upon arrival, they found 28-year-old Demetrius Baker shot in the street. Around the same time, officers discovered a 17-year-old male with a head laceration near North 8th and Locust. Then, a car crashed into a pole near North Avenue and Bartlett. Two men were found with gunshot wounds. Police say all these incidents stem back to 6th and Meinecke -- where Baker was killed. "We lost somebody last night that was true to us and meant a lot. I just don't see Demetrius shooting and killing anyone. Someone did that to him. It is very unacceptable and it does bring a lot of wariness because this is a harsh reality that we live in these days due to the fact armed weapons are put into our community," said a woman who knows the victim. Police aren't saying why a total of four men were injured in this violence spree that spanned several miles early Thursday -- or why someone wanted to kill Baker. "This was a simple situation if they didn't have a gun, the person would not simply have died -- bottom line," said a woman who knows the victim. Another man, a 28-year-old has serious injuries from gun shot wounds from the violence. Police say they are still investigating, and when asked if this is gang related as some in the community are saying, they say they have no more information to release. Baker does have a lengthy criminal record.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":115,"startIndex":106,"value":"MILWAUKEE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":360,"startIndex":354,"value":"12:13 "},"date":"2015-12-03","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":364,"startIndex":360,"value":"a.m."}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":495,"startIndex":492,"value":" 28"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":520,"startIndex":505,"value":"Demetrius Baker"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":587,"startIndex":585,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1530,"startIndex":1527,"value":" 28"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]}]}	AGBYMQY1J7PKK

4231	http://detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2016/01/27/dearborn-shooting-fairlane-mall/79425492/	Woman killed by Dearborn police near mall ‘distraught’	Woman killed by Dearborn police near mall ‘distraught’Authorities have ruled the death of a woman shot by police outside Dearborn’s Fairlane Town Center on Wednesday a homicide. Janet Wilson, 31, died from multiple gunshots, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office, which said the death was a homicide. The office was expected to turn over findings to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office. Dearborn police Chief Ron Haddad asked Michigan State Police to investigate the incident, which began earlier at JCPenney at the mall, where witnesses told police Wilson had appeared “distraught” and incapacitated, according to MSP’s Lt. Michael Shaw. Contacting state police is a “pretty common practice” across Michigan in instances of officer-involved shootings, Shaw said. The Chevy HHR the woman drove is in MSP custody, Shaw said. It was the second fatal shooting of an African-American in the last month involving a Dearborn police officer. Kevin Matthews, 35, an unarmed black man, was shot Dec. 23 by a Dearborn police officer. Friends and family have described Matthews as harmless and suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Dearborn police claim he went for an officer’s gun before he was fatally shot on Whitcomb on Detroit’s west side. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, Dearborn police have said. The Detroit Police Department is investigating that case. Haddad said Thursday that once the criminal investigations conclude, the department will conduct internal reviews on both incidents. “Both of the officer-involved shooting incidents are being independently criminally investigated by outside agencies, and we are totally committed to transparency and disclosure by fully cooperating with these investigations,” Haddad said in a statement. “While we are very proud of our long history of civil rights advocacy as well as our history of appropriate use of force, we will closely examine all of our policies and procedures to ensure that we are employing the latest training and following national best practices in all of our responsibilities to the community.” But activists, who identified Wilson on Thursday as African-American, say the second fatal shooting in as many months involving Dearborn police and unarmed suspects from Detroit underscores a need for policy changes. “Our concern is that when you have two (fatal) shootings in less than 40 days, this is a pattern,” said Chris White, a member of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality. “This is an organizational cultural problem within the Dearborn Police Department.” Wednesday’s incident remains under investigation, but Wilson appears to have tried to hit a security guard and a vehicle outside the mall with her Chevrolet HHR, Shaw said. He said no weapon was found in her vehicle. Dearborn police, who were called by mall personnel to the scene, tried to pull her over nearby but she fled onto Hubbard Drive, he said. Traffic briefly stopped the woman, but when it cleared as officers approached, she “started to speed away, almost striking an officer,” Shaw said. An officer pulled out a weapon and shot at her, he said. The Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality called for more police training. “It appears that police sworn to ‘protect and serve’ are instead exercising target practice on Detroiters and persons of color, now tragically ending in the death of yet another Detroit individual. This is a pattern and practice that we must break,” Sandra Hines, the group’s president, said in a statement Thursday. To ensure that, the coalition is calling for a probe, more information on the officer involved and a departmental overhaul, White said. “We do understand there’s a culture that exists. And no task force or civil rights statement from a PR firm is going to change the fact or bring back the lives of Wilson and Matthews.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":223,"startIndex":206,"value":"multiple gunshots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":24,"startIndex":16,"value":"Dearborn"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-20","details":{"endIndex":165,"startIndex":121,"value":"Dearborn\u2019s Fairlane Town Center on Wednesday"},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":194,"startIndex":192,"value":"31"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":190,"startIndex":178,"value":"Janet Wilson"},"race":{"endIndex":898,"startIndex":882,"value":"African-American"},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A22K31FFQVQL9H

4238	http://gazette.com/autopsy-police-shot-man-20-times-including-6-in-back/article/feed/316278	Autopsy: Police shot man 20 times, including 6 in back | Colorado Springs Gazette, News	Autopsy: Police shot man 20 times, including 6 in back | Colorado Springs Gazette, NewsSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An autopsy report shows a young black man shot dead by San Francisco police suffered 20 gunshot wounds, including six in the back, and had drugs in his system when he died in the shooting that sparked protests and calls for the chief's removal. The San Francisco coroner's report released Thursday showed that Mario Woods, 26, also had two gunshot wounds in his buttocks and others to his head, legs, abdomen and hands. Some of the wounds could have been from the same bullet, the autopsy says. It also shows that Woods had used methamphetamine, marijuana, antidepressants and cough medicine before he was shot. Investigators have said five officers opened fire on the knife-wielding Woods on Dec. 2 and that 27 shell casings were recovered at the scene where Woods died. Police had encountered him while searching for an assailant who stabbed a stranger earlier in the day. Police say Woods ignored commands to drop the knife and resisted even after he was shot several times by a "bean-bag" gun and pepper-sprayed. The shooting was captured on video and circulated widely online, igniting ongoing protests over police tactics. The department, district attorney and police commission have each launched an investigation. "It is difficult for anyone to watch videos of the shooting. Similarly, it is equally as difficult to read the medical examiner's report," the San Francisco Police Department said in a prepared statement. It said the agency is "committed to a thorough review of the shooting, and this report will be an important component of all three ongoing independent investigations." Chief Greg Suhr says he won't resign as a result of the shooting and Mayor Ed Lee says he won't fire him. Suhr and the mayor called on the U.S. Department of Justice to review department policy and procedures and advise the city on reforms. The DOJ said last week it would conduct the review. Woods family has filed a legal claim against the police and the city, arguing that officers didn't have to open fire. The family's attorney John Burris told the San Francisco Chronicle (http://sfg.ly/1o8oXdp )that the autopsy report bolsters the legal claim and that "the officers should have taken the time when they saw he was not responding, and not created a confrontation with him."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":819,"startIndex":817,"value":"27"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":100,"startIndex":87,"value":"SAN FRANCISCO"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-02","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":433,"startIndex":431,"value":"26"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":429,"startIndex":418,"value":"Mario Woods"},"race":{"endIndex":145,"startIndex":140,"value":"black"},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A75JLXESFBJ0

(January 24, 2016)--One man is dead, another is critical, and a third man is being questioned after shots rang out inside a west side business Sunday night. Shortly after 5:45 p.m., police were called to the Indiana Discount Mall at Lafayette Road and Commercial Drive on a report of two people shot. Witnesses told police two men were involved in a fist fight when one of the men pulled a gun and shot the other. A third man reportedly witnessed the shooting and pulled his own gun, shooting and killing the original shooter. Police are questioning that man and the case will be turned over to the prosecutor to review for possible charges. The deceased has been identified as Jimmy Tapia-Sevilla, 19. The coroner ruled his cause of death to be gunshot wound to the head. The other man shot is a 19-year-old male; he suffered two gunshot wounds and was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. The area where the shooting occurred was described as a secluded area at the rear of the business. Police said customers, including families with children, continued to come and go from the business following the shooting.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":82,"startIndex":70,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":268,"startIndex":260,"value":"5:45 p.m"},"date":"2016-01-25","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":244,"startIndex":239,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

The gunfire came during an altercation in the parking lot of a Kum & Go gas station near Sand Creek High School on North Carefree Circle near Peterson Road, police said. The shooting and the manhunt that followed caused a lockdown at the school, which was later lifted. A girl's basketball game against Discovery Canyon High School set for Wednesday night at Sand Creek was canceled. "Our students and staff were calm and collected," Ron Hamilton, the Sand Creek principal, said in a statement. Police said they didn't suspect there was a wider danger. "I don't think it's an event where someone is randomly shooting people," Sgt. Joel Kern said. In the 4 p.m. incident, one driver opened fire from his car in the gas station parking lot and aimed at another vehicle, police said. The vehicles collided before the drivers took off, police said. One vehicle was found near the scene after the shooting. The other car and its wounded driver turned up at a hospital, police said. Kern said arrests have not been made.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":77,"oldEnd":76,"oldStart":67,"startIndex":68,"value":"Colorado "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":952,"startIndex":946,"value":" 4 p.m"},"date":"2016-01-14","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

The incident happened at the Popeyes Restaurant at 1567 W. National Avenue around 6:00 p.m. on December 27th. According to police, as suspect #2 stayed in the alleyway near the dumpsters to act as a lookout, while suspect #1 entered the restaurant, armed with a handgun, and tried to rob the business. He was grabbed from behind by a customer who attempted to stop the robbery. During the struggle, the suspect shot the customer and both suspects fled from the scene on foot. The victim was transported to the hospital for treatment. He is expected to survive. Suspect #1 is described as a Hispanic male, 5’5”-5’8” tall, and 130 pounds. He was last seen wearing a gray skull cap, a gray bandana covering the lower half of his face, a gray hooded sweatshirt and gray pants. Suspect #2 is described as a Hispanic male, 5’11” tall, 160 pounds, with a slim build. He was last seen wearing gray clothing. Anyone with information is asked to call Milwaukee police at 414-935-7360. He was grabbed from behind by a customer who attempted to stop the robbery? This is the wrong way to do this. The correct way is to immediately shoot the perp in the head from behind. Remember the thug who put a shotgun to the Aldi’s clerk’s head? The samaritan in line shot his dumb ass and neutralized the threat. That is how it’s done people.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":544,"startIndex":537,"value":"handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":101,"startIndex":91,"value":"MILWAUKEE "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":366,"startIndex":357,"value":"6:00 p.m."},"date":"2015-12-27","details":{"endIndex":349,"startIndex":303,"value":" Popeyes Restaurant at 1567 W.

(Dec. 22 2015) -- Violent crime is on the rise in Indianapolis. Monday night and early Tuesday morning, three people were shot in the span of just a few hours and new numbers show a dramatic spike in the number of non-fatal shootings in the city this year. One of the shootings took place near 19th and Park. Walking down the sidewalk, 19-year-old Trevion Taylor fell victim to violence. “As we kept walking, all I hear is, ‘Stop. Freeze.’ Then he shot once and hit me in my leg,” said Taylor, who suffered a broken bone in his ankle after being shot and barely escaped being hit a second time. “I tried to run and I stumbled and he shot again.” Just a few blocks away, in a separate unrelated crime, a 22-year-old was shot in the cheek at a gas station on College after meeting a suspect to sell a jacket he posted online. Those crimes, along with a third shooting on the east side, all proved non-fatal. As of this past weekend, there have been 437 non-fatal shootings in the city this year. That is nearly a hundred more than the 350 shootings in 2014 and 345 the year before that. The city’s public safety director thinks easy access to firearms is a big reason behind the spike. “It is a first resort now to use a firearm rather than a last resort,” said Public Safety Director David Wantz. Wantz cautions everyone that the crime numbers will not be quick and easy to around quickly. “This is a long term kind of problem, that they have to do simple things like go out and vote, like go to neighborhood meetings, like do the kinds of crime watch things that have been done for years and years,” said Wantz. As for Taylor, his wounds still wrapped and painful, the shooting served as a wake-up call for him and he hopes for an end to the near non-stop violence in the city. “I’m telling you I ain’t never thought about me ever getting shot,” said Taylor. “It’s crazy cause there ain’t no telling who could be shot next.” So far no one has been arrested for any of the three overnight shootings.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":110,"startIndex":98,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-22","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":194,"oldEnd":193,"oldStart":187,"startIndex":188,"value":"night "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

(December 12, 2015) — One person is dead after an officer-involved shooting on the city’s far east side. Shortly before 11:30 a.m., police responded to a report of a suicidal person in the 7900 block of Red Mill Drive. That scene is near East 38th Street and North Franklin Road. Police have identified the decedent as 25-year-old Christopher Goodlow of Indianapolis. A witness told police a male was standing near the entrance of the apartment complex holding a large knife and appeared to have cut himself. Police surrounded the knife-wielding man and made repeated loud verbal commands to drop the knife. The man refused and officers deployed tasers, striking the man twice. Officers were still unsuccessful in their attempts to secure the weapon. At one point an officer attempted to subdue the armed man by tackling him to the ground. As the man continued to wave the knife at the officer, the officer disengaged. According to police, the man continued to confront officers, pointing the knife at them. Police say the man then charged at one of the officers with his arm fully extended pointing the knife directly at the officer. At that point, two of the responding officers fired their weapons. The man went down and medical personnel were immediately summoned. In spite of life-saving efforts, the man died.

Police say 40-year-old Michael Schafrik was shot and killed during an altercation. The alleged shooter, a 14-year-old Milwaukee boy, was arrested as were another 14-year-old boy and a 33-year-old woman. It’s believed an argument between the victim’s group and the suspect’s group preceded the shooting. Orlando Pacheco witnessed this shooting, which happened around 4:30 p.m. "We just came from here, and I live right around the corner. And then we came back, and we seen all this stuff. Like, 'oh, my God!' I was like, 'dang! I think it was gunshots!' There was a lot of running around and people looking around to see what`s going on. It's stupid. Why would an argument lead to killing somebody? People these days are not caring about anybody these days. They're not, you know?" Pacheco said. MPD continues to investigate and will present the case to the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office in the coming days. This is the second homicide in the city of Milwaukee in 2016. The first homicide in 2016 came Sunday, January 3rd. 45-year-old Deondrick Byrd was shot and killed near 6th and Wright. I expect more from this adult. He should know better than to go around shooting at things. Who is responsible for bringing a child up like this? Who promoted that acting like this is ok? Your parents should be ashamed of themselves for failing to raise a respectful young man. Do the right thing, not the wrong thing. I wish we could get away from this thug raising thug paradigm. Is it me or do these 1st and 2nd homicide of the year stories come off as exciting to anyone that covers media in Milwaukee??? I mean that probably isn’t the intention but that’s how myself and at least 13 other people in the conversation agreed that it seems like… Just curious…	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":117,"startIndex":108,"value":"Milwaukee"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":634,"startIndex":625,"value":"4:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-01-05","details":{"endIndex":257,"startIndex":236,"value":"near 10th and Lincoln"},"state":"WI - Wisconsin","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":367,"startIndex":365,"value":"14"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":272,"startIndex":270,"value":"40"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":299,"startIndex":282,"value":"Michael Schafrik "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A138BU1VWM2RKN

(WBFF)-- 45-year-old Christine A. Lucas was fatally shot by Cecil County troopers overnight in Rising Sun. The troopers responded to a call for an intruder early Sunday morning, on Lombard Road off of Mt. Olivet Road shortly before 2:00 a.m. Deputies, troopers, and an officer from the Rising Sun Police responded to the two-story single family home. They heard a woman screaming inside and forced their way into the home, through the garage. The troopers, in uniform, repeatedly announced they were police. Due to the electricity in the home being shut off, troopers used flashlights to light their way through the first floor to the living room. Two troopers and the police officer discovered Lucas seated in a chair. They gave her verbal commands, in which she did not respond. She put her hands in her lap, then picked up an apparent handgun. She told them that she did not believe they were the "real police." The officials told Lucas to drop the gun and assured her they were there to help. After ignoring their commands, she raised the gun towards them. The troopers, in fear for their lives, fired their .40 caliber pistols at Ms. Lucas. Trooper Timothy Graham, a flight paramedic, provided immediate care to the victim before medics responded to the scene. Despite care and treatment from medics, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. The Maryland State Police Homicide Unit investigators later learned that the victim's 15-year-old son was sleeping upstairs when the shooting occurred. He later told police he was unharmed and was sleeping in the living room earlier when his mother awakened him. She handed him a duffel bag with his clothes inside and told him she loved him and to stay upstairs. She also told him where to find his birth certificate and her personal information. Authorities say Ms. Lucas had not taken her prescribed medication for the past couple of weeks. Her husband was not at the home when the incident occurred on January 10. They also learned the family was having financial difficulties, as the electricity in the home was turned off, possibly as long as four months. A search warrant revealed that the gun Lucas had was an air-soft pistol, painted black to give it the realistic look of a real gun. They also found an apparent suicide note giving an explanation for her actions. The troopers involved in the shooting, Trooper First Class Justin Rann, a four-year veteran assigned to the North East Barrack and Trooper First Class Timothy Graham, a four-year veteran assigned to the Aviation Command, have been placed on administrative leave.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1255,"startIndex":1236,"value":".40 caliber pistols"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":118,"startIndex":108,"value":"RISING SUN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":366,"oldEnd":365,"oldStart":355,"startIndex":356,"value":"2:00 a.m. "},"date":"2016-01-10","details":{"endIndex":341,"startIndex":305,"value":"Lombard Road off of Mt.

LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) - A 3-year-old boy was shot and killed in his north St. Louis County home Monday morning. St. Louis County Police were looking for a teenager in connection with the tragedy. The 15-year-old turned himself in to police late Monday afternoon after a four hour search. St. Louis County Police received a call about a shooting around 11:45am Monday. When they arrived at a house in the 1600 block of Emerald Creek Drive, they found that Xzavier 'Zae' Robinson, 3, had been shot. The toddler was rushed to St. Louis Children's Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Investigators say there were several witnesses in the house at the time of the shooting. The child's father, Shawmane Robinson, did not want to talk on camera, but says he was asleep when his son was shot, allegedly by a 15-year-old boy who is family friend. Robinson says he did not hear any gunfire, and didn't know what happened, until relatives came into his bedroom and told him his son had been shot. "The three-year-old boy was shot at least once, it appears in the abdomen. He was declared from the gunshot wound." said Officer Sean McGuire. "It's tragic no matter when a life is taken, but to be three years old with Christmas this week. A lot of detectives, a lot of police officers, a lot of people in this neighborhood all have kids. So our biggest thing is trying to get this person into custody as soon as possible." Police have not recovered the weapon used to kill the toddler. A family member says he doesn't believe the teen meant to shoot the child and believes it was a tragic accident.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1118,"startIndex":1105,"value":"at least once"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":92,"startIndex":76,"value":"ST.

Officers Eric Anderson, 41, and Jason Sweeney, 39, have been placed on administrative leave per department procedure. The incident all started Friday evening, January 8th shortly after 5:00 p.m. Officials say a man was shot and killed by an officer in Walworth County, after he allegedly tried to break into a resident’s home. Officials say the man then became combative with the homeowner before ignoring police demands. Broken glass was scattered in the snow outside of the home on Lincoln Drive, while the owner, who chose not to be identified, recounted the frightening ordeal. “There were people over. They all started screaming. I came out of my room and to the other room. I could see a battle axe coming through the window over and over again,” said the homeowner. While his guests took cover in a back room, the homeowner went outside to confront the suspect. “It was fight or flight,” said the homeowner. “The person had some issues, wanted to get to some people, appeared to be deranged, eyes were wild, wasn’t reasonable and then turned toward me and started coming at me with the axe swinging it. He then reached back and pulled out a chain and started whipping it in the air and going after me with that.” The man dodged the weapons and tried to keep the suspect at bay until help arrived. PHOTO GALLERY: “Then the police officers came. They came on the front line. This person redirected himself toward them. They surrounded him, and he pulled out a dagger. He was holding it out — threatening them. Then they gave him warnings,” said the homeowner. When the resident went inside, shots were fired. “I came out and seen he had fallen to the ground on his side. There was no movement,” said the homeowner. The homeowner recognized the suspect and said he knew him from around town. “He had some issues in the past, psychological issues. He snapped. Something was off this day. The police had to do their job. They are not at fault. They showed up to do what they were supposed to do. The person was acting irrational and out of control. He had to stop himself and he chose not to,” said the homeowner. The Walworth County Sheriff’s Office and the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation will continue their investigation into this incident. Deserve has nothing to do with it……..”deserve” is a subjective opinion. It boils down to facts: the loser was creating a disturbance and when he didn’t obey Officers’ commands he approached them with a weapon and was dispatched. Maybe the LEO’s should have waited until one of them was hurt before using force? Sure, then the LEO’s family could say ‘If only he would have used his training he wouldn’t have been hurt like that’. What the hell!!! You’ve got to be high on something. Libertarian your the reason there are stupid children that grow up to be stupid adults. Throw more taxpayers money at problems that parents create. There is no amount of money to fix STUPID, just look at our current president.

This persons comment is stupid.. I mean this person acts as if they were there and seen the whole thing. And yes he was wrong for carrying a gun but.

4626	http://fox6now.com/2015/12/07/milwaukee-police-cab-driver-shot-near-n-84th-and-glendale/	Caught on camera: Cab driver robbed, shot; police retrieve photos from inside vehicle | FOX6Now.com	Caught on camera: Cab driver robbed, shot; police retrieve photos from inside vehicle | FOX6Now.comMILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee police are looking for two suspects who robbed and shot a Milwaukee taxi driver on the city's north side -- and video surveillance could help crack the case. The shooting happened near 84th and Glendale Ave. late on Sunday, December 6th. Officials say just before 11:30 p.m., the 64-year-old victim was shot in the back after two suspects robbed him of money. The victim was taken to a hospital for treatment of a non-life threatening injury. As police processed the scene overnight and examined evidence into the day on Monday, they came across something that could very well lead them to the suspects. The cab was equipped with a surveillance camera which captures interactions with customers inside and outside of the vehicle. The red taxi, operated by the 64-year-old driver who was shot, rolled into the maintenance facility at American United Taxicab Services on Monday afternoon. Police later released photos captured by the surveillance camera -- one captured very clear pictures of one of the suspects. Police say one suspect is described as a male, black, 30-35 years old, 5’11” tall, weighing about 230 pounds, with heavy build and a mustache. He was wearing a gray, hooded sweatshirt with the hood up and dark pants armed with a black semiautomatic handgun. The second suspect is described as a male, black, 30-35 years, 5’8” tall, weighing about 230 pounds, with a heavy build. He was wearing a light-gray hooded jacket with the hood up and dark pants. Red Christensen, vice president of the cab company, said what's most important to him after this incident is the condition of his long-time employee. "We all wish him the best," Christensen said. Fellow cab driver Arjun Bherdwaj says he empathizes with the victim in this case, as he, too has been a target in the past. "He asked me to take him somewhere. I took him there -- and I felt something over there and it was a gun. I was like 'wow.' I was like, really scared and he put the gun over there," Bherdwaj said. For cab drivers, coming across dangerous people is a risk that comes along with the job. But with the added security measures like the surveillance cameras inside vehicles, Christensen says most of the time, the bad guys get caught. "We also screen a lot of the calls that come into our dispatch too, so all of our calls are recorded and everything is on video and audio. We`ve had numerous robberies through the years, but very few -- and they`ve all been caught through the camera system -- so it works," Christensen said. Yooper, think about the stuff that DOESN”T get reported, ever thought of that? The control what they want you to see bro. MSM is controlled. Look at it this way, Control through Fear. Sometimes you use fear to train a dog, even a child. The Elites are our parents. WE the PEOPLE are the kids. Raise your hand if you do not understand this dynamic. Yes it’s been happening for ages. Yes it’s F’kt up! Wake up and arm yourself while you can, tell the truth and don’t fall victim to the greedy scum bags that rule this earth. Stand up for the REAL America, LIFE, LIBERTY, Real TRUE American Patriots should continue to denounce the scripted Main Stream Media and continue to learn about our shadow gov’t.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1390,"startIndex":1363,"value":"black semiautomatic handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":108,"startIndex":99,"value":"MILWAUKEE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":395,"startIndex":386,"value":"11:30 p.m"},"date":"2015-12-06","details":{"endIndex":329,"startIndex":307,"value":"84th and Glendale Ave."},"state":"WI - Wisconsin","time-day":{"endIndex":604,"startIndex":599,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1203,"startIndex":1188,"value":"30-35 years old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1186,"startIndex":1181,"value":"black"}},{"age":{"endIndex":1453,"startIndex":1442,"value":"30-35 years"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1186,"startIndex":1181,"value":"black"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":413,"startIndex":402,"value":"64-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AGBA9QNP2BKR1

4693	http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/01/15/police-say-fatal-garland-shooting-was-self-defense/	Police Say Fatal Garland Shooting Was Self-Defense « CBS Dallas / Fort Worth	Police Say Fatal Garland Shooting Was Self-Defense « CBS Dallas / Fort WorthUPDATE TUESDAY, JANUARY 19: Garland Police have identified the man who was shot on January 15, in the 900 block of Green Pond, as Stephen Wray Smith II of Allen, Texas. GARLAND (CBSDFW.COM) – A shooting at a home in Garland early Friday morning left one man dead, and authorities are calling it an act of self-defense. Garland police identify the man killed as the suspect in this case. They say the incident began with a fight between the homeowner and the suspect shortly before midnight near the intersection of Green Pond Drive and Citadel Drive. According to police, the suspect was at the shooter’s home and the two men got into some sort of argument. The suspect left the scene, but a text message to the homeowner from the suspect’s ex-girlfriend, received a short time later, warned that he was coming back and for the homeowner to be careful. That man parked down the street from the home and walked back to the house. In anticipation of the suspect’s return, the homeowner kept a lookout on his home security camera. Police said, as he waited, watching, someone cut the camera wire and the screen went dark. The homeowner then went outside armed with a gun. “Homeowner has cameras, saw one camera stopped working,” said Lt. Pedro Barineau with the Garland Police Department on Friday morning. “Suspect was across the street and came at him in an aggressive manner, came onto his property.” Police explained that the suspect was yelling and approaching the homeowner with something in his hand. The homeowner felt threatened by the man and opened fire, killing that man in the home’s driveway. Barineau continued, “The homeowner feared for his life and shot him.” Neighbors found the shooting alarming. They said that this is a quiet neighborhood, and can not recall any disturbances at the home in the past. Matthew Lee lives across the street from the home, and recorded cell phone video of the incident after calling authorities. “I heard voices outside, got progressively louder,” he recalled. “Eventually, I heard a couple of loud voices. I heard bangs and two screams, and it got quiet. And that’s when I called 911.” Law enforcement officials have only identified the suspect as a 47-year-old male; at this time they’re searching for family to notify. They towed his vehicle after completing the crime scene investigation. The homeowner’s name has not been released. The homeowner was interviewed by investigators, along with one or two other people who were inside of the house at the time of this incident. Authorities stated that it is unlikely that the shooter will face charges. “As a homeowner, you have the right to protect yourself and your property,” Barineau added. “A person came onto his property. He was in fear.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":111,"startIndex":104,"value":"Garland"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-15","details":{"endIndex":201,"startIndex":178,"value":"900 block of Green Pond"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":313,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":2276,"startIndex":2274,"value":"47"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":227,"startIndex":206,"value":"Stephen Wray Smith II"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1GHXMXKIFX672

Now his family wants to know why someone would take his life. Family members told WLKY that Aaron Williams, 26, lived for his 2-year-old daughter. Williams died Wednesday night from multiple gunshot wounds. No one has yet been arrested in connection to his death. ???I was numb. That's how I???ve been for the past few days really," William???s father, Eric Price said. Price hoped the rumors were wrong when he heard his son was found dead inside a car on Old Manslick Road. Price watched his son excel in sports as captain of the DuPont Manual High School basketball team. Williams wore No. 10. "He was on the all-tournament team in the King of the Bluegrass that year. He broke four records during that tournament. He had 42 points in one game," Price said. ?? Williams later pursued his bachelor's degree at Morehead State University. According to Price, he was working on finishing up his degree at the University of Louisville.

Colorado Springs police went to the 2400 block of North Union Boulevard shortly after 12:30 a.m. to investigate a report of shots being fired. Upon further investigation, officers determined that three people had been shot near the Union Station bar in the central part of the city. According to police, the three people were taken to a local hospital with “non-life threatening injuries.” Witnesses told police that there were two shooters. Police Lt. Brian Steckler told The Gazette’s news partners at KKTV that “one of the victims went back inside the bar after being shot, and then at that time (a person inside the bar) saw that this person was shot and that created a little bit of a panic, and then the bar shut down.” Police were looking for a light colored SUV that one of the two shooters may have been driving.

(CBS4)– The driver who was shot in the head while driving in Aurora on Tuesday morning, then crashing into another vehicle, has died from those injuries. Police are offering a $2,000 reward in the case. The victim, identified as Jevon Antwaine Bailey, died on Tuesday. Detectives investigated his death as a homicide but did not confirm it was road rage. Police rushed to the intersection of Iliff and Troy on Tuesday morning on reports of a car accident. When officers arrived, they discovered the driver of one of the vehicles had been shot in the head. The driver of the other vehicle in the crash was not injured. Police continue to investigate and search for the gunman described as a black male driving a white sedan. Investigators say the suspect vehicle was seen following Bailey’s vehicle, a blue Volkswagen Jetta, in the neighborhood north of the shooting scene. When Bailey stopped at the stop sign at East Warren Drive and East Iliff Avenue, the supsect’s vehicle pulled alongside Bailey’s VW where the men had a brief verbal exchange. As Bailey pulled into the intersection, shots were fired by the suspect and one bullet struck and killed Bailey. That’s when Bailey’s car collided with another vehicle. A memorial for Bailey has been scheduled for 6 p.m. at Utah Park in Aurora. Friends say they’re shocked to learn what happened. “He’s just like a big, cuddly teddy bear. He wouldn’t even harm a fly and for something to happen to him like that… it’s crazy,” said Bailey’s friend AJ Franklin.

Officers saw 27-year-old Grant Headley driving in Dorchester around 10:20 a.m. and knew his drivers license was suspended, so they boxed him in to stop him on Mount Bowdoin Terrace. Evans said Headley got out of his car and started shooting “unprovoked” at one police officer, hitting him in the leg. “The officer quickly exchanged gunfire,” Evans said, adding that Headley then ran away. Listen: Police Radio Transmission Other officers at the scene ran after Headley, tackled him and took his automatic Glock .40 mm handgun, according to the commissioner, who said Headley was not hurt. The wounded officer, who has not been publicly identified yet, tried to apply his own tourniquet to his wound. He was helped by another officer and rushed to Boston Medical Center, about 20 minutes away. Related: Headley Has Lengthy Criminal Record “It could have saved his life,” Evans said, “and at least saved his leg.” The officer’s wife met him at the hospital, where he is currently in intensive care with a serious, but non-life-threatening leg wound. Boston Police said he was in fair condition late Friday night. He is a highly decorated, nine-year veteran of the department, assigned to the Mattapan Drug Control Unit. He was about to be honored with a commendation for a recent gun arrest, Evans said. A woman who lives in the neighborhood told WBZ-TV she heard 5-to-6 gunshots. When she looked outside, she didn’t see the injured officer, but there was quite a bit of police activity. Investigators remained at the scene several hours after the shooting, collecting evidence in and around Headley’s car. Evans said Headley, a Dorchester resident, is a drug dealer out on probation who was well-known to police. He was released in April 2015 after serving five years in state prison on firearm and drug dealing convictions. “He was out selling drugs and that’s why he was pulled over,” Evans told reporters outside the hospital. The commissioner praised the restraint of his officers in capturing Headley without deadly force. “This individual has a dangerous past,” Evans said. “I’m sure he’s desperate and he doesn’t want to go back to jail.” Watch: Commissioner Evans Update On Shooting “My prayers go out to the family of this young officer and I commend him for his work,” said Mayor Marty Walsh after he and the commissioner visited the officer in the hospital. Watch: Mayor Walsh On Shooting Headley is expected to be arraigned Monday. The suspect’s father, who saw his son not long before the shooting, says he can’t explain any of this. “He came from a good family,” said Grantley Headley. “We don’t condone that kind of behavior. I don’t know what he does when he’s not here. When he’s here, he’s pretty respectful kid.” “The police around here do a very a good job protecting us,” Headley says. “I have a lot of respect for the Boston Police.” Pat Rose, President of the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association, said the public should be outraged. “The bottom line is though we are the targets, we are the targets and that’s wrong,” Rose said. “It’s become far too common for people to take shots at police officers across this country and it can’t be tolerated the public has to step up.” WBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Doug Cope reports	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":745,"startIndex":725,"value":"Glock .40 mm handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":280,"startIndex":270,"value":"Dorchester"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":297,"startIndex":288,"value":"10:20 a.m"},"date":"2016-01-01","details":{"endIndex":401,"startIndex":378,"value":" Mount Bowdoin Terrace."},"state":"MA - Massachusetts","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":235,"startIndex":233,"value":"27"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":258,"startIndex":245,"value":"Grant Headley"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A26T6O5EFR54A9

In the statement on the early morning shooting issued late Saturday by the mayor, Emanuel says that "anytime an officer uses force the public deserves answers, and regardless of the circumstances, we all grieve anytime there is a loss of life in our city." Authorities said the shooting around 4:25 a.m. Saturday happened after officers were confronted by a "combative subject." The Cook County medical examiner's office and family members say 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier and 55-year-old Bettie Jones were killed. Police said late Saturday that Jones was accidentally struck. Emanuel's statement notes the shooting is being investigated the by city's Independent Police Review Authority and that findings will be referred to the county prosecutor for review. 9:45 p.m. Chicago Police say a 55-year-old woman fatally shot by one or more officers was "accidentally struck and tragically killed." A statement from Chicago Police also says the department extends its deepest condolences to the victim's family and friends. The woman, Bettie Jones, was one of two people killed by police in the shooting early Saturday. The other was identified as 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier. The statement said the officer or officers involved will be placed on routine administrative duties for 30 days as a result of the shooting. 5:50 p.m. The father of a 19-year-old killed by a Chicago police officer says he had invited his son to a holiday gathering before the shooting but he chose not to go. Antonio LeGrier tells the Chicago Sun-Times when he returned to his apartment early Saturday, his son Quintonio LeGrier appeared to be a "little agitated." He says he heard loud banging on his locked bedroom door around 4:15 a.m. and that his son tried to bust the door open. He says he kept the son from breaking the door down and called police. LeGrier says he called his downstairs neighbor, 55-year-old Bettie Jones, and warned her about his son and not to open the door unless police arrived. He says Jones told him she saw Quintonio outside with a baseball bat. When police arrived, LeGrier says he started making his way down from the second floor and heard gunshots. He says he saw his son and Jones lying in the foyer. He says his son had emotional problems, but that it didn't warrant him getting shot and killed. 12:48 p.m. The brother of a 55-year-old woman shot and killed by a Chicago police officer says his sister was the mother of four daughters and a son. Melvin Jones tells the Chicago Tribune that more than a dozen family members celebrated Christmas with Bettie Jones on Friday. Jones says his sister "had an excellent Christmas." Authorities say Bettie Jones and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier were killed early Saturday when police responded to a domestic disturbance call. Bettie Jones, a neighbor of LeGrier, lived in a first-floor apartment with her boyfriend. Her children range in age from 19 to 38. They include 19-year-old twins. Melvin Jones says he's "numb right now." He says there is "a whole lot of anger, a whole lot of tears." 12:20 p.m. The mother of a 19-year-old man shot and killed by a Chicago police officer says her son was studying engineering at Northern Illinois University. Janet Cooksey tells the Chicago Tribune that Quintonio LeGrier graduated from Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy in Chicago and "was going somewhere." Authorities say LeGrier and 55-year-old Bettie Jones, both of Chicago, died in the police shooting early Saturday. Cooksey tells WLS-TV that her son was "having a mental situation." She says sometimes he would "get loud, but not violent." 11:20 a.m. The Cook County medical examiner has identified two people killed in a Chicago police shooting as a 19-year-old black man and 55-year-old black woman.

Jones was pronounced dead at Loretto Hospital at 4:51 a.m. LeGrier was pronounced dead at Stroger Hospital at 5:14 a.m. The medical examiner's office says autopsies have not been scheduled. Earlier Saturday, Chicago police said an officer responding to a domestic disturbance shot and killed two people after being "confronted by a combative subject." Police said the shooting is under investigation and the case has been referred to the city's main police oversight agency. 10:24 a.m. Chicago police say an officer responding to a domestic disturbance shot and killed two people. The Chicago Police Department said in a statement that the shooting happened at about 4:25 a.m. Saturday after responding officers "were confronted by a combative subject" on the city's West Side. Police said the shooting is under investigation and the case has been referred to the city's main police oversight agency. Independent Police Review Authority spokesman Larry Merritt confirmed Saturday that the agency was investigating but had no further information.

The Chicago Police Department is the subject of a federal civil rights investigation, which came after the release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager 16 times in 2014. This story has been corrected throughout to show the first name of the 19-year-old killed is Quintonio instead of Quientonio, the last name is LeGrier instead of Legrier and the first name of the 55-year-old killed is Bettie instead of Betty.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":98,"startIndex":91,"value":"CHICAGO"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":247,"startIndex":238,"value":"10:15 p.m"},"date":"2015-12-27","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

(January 24, 2016)—Police spent much of Sunday afternoon looking for a man who had shot his own father outside a home on the city’s southeast side. In a strange twist to the story, the son showed up at the same hospital his dad was taken to with a gunshot wound to his own leg. Late Sunday morning police were called to the 1900 block of Cross Willow Lane on a report of a person shot. That scene is near Brookville Road and South Franklin Road. The victim was identified as 54-year-old Sammy Hope Sr. Hope told police he and his son, 27-year-old Sammy Hope Jr. were in the car arguing when Sammy Jr shot his father in the leg and then fled. Sammy Hope Sr. was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in good condition. Police say about five hours later a man walked into Eskenazi Hospital with a leg gunshot wound as well. According to investigators the man gave a fake name and a false account of how he got shot. Detectives say they saw through his story and determined the man was actually the son who shot his father earlier in the day. Police believe Hope Jr. likely shot himself in the leg and then later drove himself to the hospital for treatment. Police placed the younger Hope under arrest for aggravated battery. The case is still under investigation.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":96,"startIndex":84,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-24","details":{"endIndex":249,"startIndex":235,"value":"southeast side"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":159,"startIndex":150,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":640,"startIndex":638,"value":"27"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":663,"startIndex":650,"value":"Sammy Hope Jr"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":580,"startIndex":578,"value":"54"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":603,"startIndex":590,"value":"Sammy Hope Sr"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2I4GBMHESWFQH

The shooting in New York erupted during the wake services for Leroy Smith, 42, one of two men fatally shot outside a Wilkes-Barre bar on Jan. 17. "We've been in contact with that department and that's all I can say right now," Wilkes-Barre Detective Brent Sevison said. A man arriving to pay his respects to Smith was critically wounded by gunshots amid an argument with another man, according to published reports in New York. The shooter fled while the wounded man stumbled into the funeral home and collapsed. The Queens Chronicle newspaper said New York police think the funeral parlor shooting was connected to the slayings in Wilkes-Barre. Sevison would not say if authorities have established a link between the two cases. Smith and Jamel Martin, 20, were fatally shot outside Don Kasper's Watering Hole at 129 Scott St. around 2:30 a.m. Jan. 17. Smith died at the scene, and Martin later died at a local hospital. No suspects have been identified and police are urging anyone with information to come forward. "We're still working hard on it and we're going to continue to do so," Sevison said. "If anyone has any first-hand information, call or come in. We'll be glad to talk to them."

(Jan. 20, 2016)-- Several parents at Plainfield High School are once again concerned for their child’s safety after a man was arrested for bringing a loaded hand gun into the building during Tuesday’s cyber threats forum. Ronald Kendall, 37, was taken into police custody after officers found a loaded handgun inside of his jacket. “He turned around and told people that he had brought a gun into the forum and that he was not checked at the door with security,” said Plainfield Police Captain Jill Lees. Kendall was sitting with hundreds of other parents and community members Tuesday who were asking officials for more information about the ongoing cyber threat investigation that has closed down schools, a mall, and created havoc in the Town of Plainfield. “There were bullets in the magazine. I was unsure if there was one in the chamber but obviously using officer safety we had to make sure we cleared the weapons safely,” said Lees. Officers don’t think Kendall showed up to ask questions, but seemed to want to make a statement. Telling the crowd he was able to easily sneak the weapon past security. “We escorted him out really quickly and right there in the lobby we were able to handle the situation and make sure we confiscated the gun,” said Lees. After parents found out that Kendall had been sitting amongst them with a loaded hand gun, they took to social media expressing even more concerns about their child’s safety. Police say there was no viable threat directed at the forum or they would have searched everyone. “There is a fine line and a balance between safety and practicality. This was a voluntary event that people can attend. It is no different than attending any other public place,” said Lees. FOX59 knocked on Kendall’s door, but no one answered. Neighbors tell FOX59 he has children in the Plainfield school district. Plainfield Police do not believe this incident is connected to the continuous cyber threats against the town. Kendall is facing felony charges. He bonded out of the Hendricks County Jail Tuesday night.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":90,"startIndex":80,"value":"PLAINFIELD"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-20","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

The suspect was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the building, which was in a brief lockdown, was cleared. The victim, a doctor at Brigham and Women’s, was shot twice and sustained life-threatening injuries, said Boston Police Commissioner William Evans at a press conference. The incident occurred shortly after 11 a.m., and the hospital returned to normal operations later Tuesday afternoon, according to tweets from the Boston Police Department and BWH. The suspect was found in an exam room with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Evans said. Police found a gun beside the suspect. During the press conference, Evans praised the efforts of hospital staff in responding to the incident. “Within the last year, we’ve done several trainings here on this very scenario, an active shooter scenario. When we came up to this hospital, everyone was doing exactly what we trained for,” Evans said. “That’s why we do this training, and I have to commend their response.” BWH President Betsy Nabel posted a message on the hospital’s Facebook page Tuesday afternoon. “As you know, there was an active shooter event this morning in Shapiro,” she said. “I want to reassure you that the hospital is now safe and secure.” UPDATE 7:33 p.m: In a release, BPD identified the suspect as Stephen Pasceri, 55, of Millbury. BWH said in a tweet that the the victim, whose family has requested that they remain anonymous, was in surgery as of 4:34 p.m. The Boston Globe, citing a law enforcement official briefed on the situation, identified the victim as 44-year-old Michael Davidson, who has been a cardiovascular surgeon at BWH since 2006. UPDATE 10:45 p.m.: Davidson has died as a result of his injuries, according to a press release from BWH. UPDATE Wednesday 12:01 a.m.: Boston Mayor Martin Walsh issued a statement in regards to the shooting. “I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Dr. Michael Davidson,” Walsh said. “This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his colleagues at Brigham and Women’s Hospital during this difficult time.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":435,"startIndex":429,"value":" twice"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":489,"oldEnd":488,"oldStart":481,"startIndex":482,"value":"Boston "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":588,"startIndex":582,"value":"11 a.m"},"date":"2016-01-19","details":{"endIndex":137,"startIndex":109,"value":"Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital"},"state":"MA - Massachusetts","time-day":{"endIndex":153,"startIndex":146,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1576,"startIndex":1574,"value":"55"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1572,"startIndex":1557,"value":"Stephen Pasceri"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1832,"startIndex":1821,"value":"44-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1849,"startIndex":1833,"value":"Michael Davidson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1576,"startIndex":1574,"value":"55"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1572,"startIndex":1557,"value":"Stephen Pasceri"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3I59QQFHW90AH

Dane Gallion, 29, was at a screening of Michael Bay's "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi" on January 21, when his gun discharged, hitting a 40-year-old woman in the shoulder. She was in serious condition, but was in stable condition by Saturday. In a statement released by police, Gallion said he had the gun because he was “concerned about recent mass shootings in public places,” so he kept the gun unholstered. Gallion left the theater after the shooting, and according to a theater patron, "seemed like he was intoxicated." After Gallion returned home, his father called 911, saying that his son was upset and claimed the gun had fallen out of his pocket and discharged. Since then, Gallion's description of the event has changed. Police say that Gallion told an arresting officer that someone reached for his crotch, so he accidentally fired the weapon. He later said at the station that someone had been bothering him before the gun accidentally went off. His bail was set at $25,000 and he will appear in court for a second time Tuesday.

Flint police Chief James Tolbert tells The Flint Journal that Karmelo Johnson was found dead after shooting himself in the head Wednesday night with a 9mm pistol at his great-grandparents’ home. Police say a preliminary investigation indicated that the child found the unsecured weapon at the home, in the 1300 block of Columbia Dr., and that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted. Tolbert says the gun wasn’t registered and investigators believe the adults present at the time weren’t aware there was a handgun in the home. Tolbert has said his agency was seeking help from federal authorities to trace the gun and find out how it got into the home. No arrests have been announced and it was not immediately clear if anyone would face charges in connection with the death. Tolbert said,results of the investigation, when complete, would be forwarded to the Genesee County Prosecutor’s Office for review.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":400,"startIndex":390,"value":"9mm pistol"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":155,"startIndex":150,"value":"Flint"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-20","details":{"endIndex":571,"startIndex":546,"value":"300 block of Columbia Dr."},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":382,"startIndex":377,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":124,"startIndex":123,"value":"3"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":316,"startIndex":301,"value":"Karmelo Johnson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":124,"startIndex":123,"value":"3"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":316,"startIndex":301,"value":"Karmelo Johnson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME

Bernard Snell, 45, of Westmoreland, was arrested and charged with second-degree assault the morning of Jan.5, over a week from when the shooting took place. Officials say Snell shot 43-year-old Kevin Barber while the two were tracking a deer on a property near the corner of Jenkins and Springhouse Road Dec. 20. The two men were already separated when Snell believed he saw the injured deer 20 to 25 yards away in heavy brush. Police say Snell waited a short time to confirm what he saw and then aimed and fired his .50 caliber muzzleloader. Snell immediately realized Barber had been hit and called 9-1-1 for help, according to police. Barber was taken to St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Utica and then transported to SUNY Upstated Medical Hospital in Syracuse for further treatment. The Dec. 20 incident was the second hunting accident in December to result in criminal charges. Three days prior to Snell's arrest, 53-year-old Michael Quail was arrested and charged with felony reckless endangerment and assault. Quail's charges stemmed from a Dec. 6 hunting accident near Route 221 and Fish Hill Road in the Town of Willet where he allegedly shot and injured 24-year-old William Cobb. The two men did not know each other and apparently didn't realize they were hunting in the same area. Cobb was taken to a hospital in Syracuse, where he was being treated for a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Snell and Quail's cases are not related. Investigators in both incidents called the shootings "accidents."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":181,"startIndex":169,"value":"WESTMORELAND"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-05","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

5413	http://m.krcrtv.com/nationalnews/deadly-san-bernardino-shooting/36763344	What we know: San Bernardino shooting | National News - KRCR Home	What we know: San Bernardino shooting | National News - KRCR HomeWhat started as a festive holiday event in San Bernardino, California, ended in a massacre, with 14 people killed and 21 others wounded or hurt while trying to escape. The shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School ??i n Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, where 26 people, mostly children, died. Authorities say there were two shooters. A U.S. citizen named Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, who was an inspector with the county health department that was hosting the party, and his wife, 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik. David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said the couple "were radicalized and have been for quite some time." Farook and Malik planned out the attack in advance, Bowdich said, practicing at gun ranges in the Los Angeles area, including within days of the shooting. While the couple supported ISIS, investigators are still trying to find out if either of them ever actually met any ISIS leaders or took orders from anyone. Once again after a mass shooting, President Barack Obama immediately appealed for something to be done to prevent more heartache. "Right now, it's too easy," he said. "We're going to have to search ourselves as a society ... to take basic steps that would make it harder -- not impossible, but harder -- to let individuals get access to weapons." The attack:??The attack took place around 11 a.m. during a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California. It's a facility for people with developmental disabilities. Farook abruptly left the center before the shooting "under circumstances described as angry," said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan. Soon after, Farook came back with Malik. They were armed and fired 65 to 75 rounds, police said, killing at least 14 people and wounding at least 21. The couple then escaped in a dark-colored, rented Ford SUV with Utah plates. Officers went with a search warrant to the couple's rented apartment in the neighboring city of Redlands, where they saw a black SUV drive by them, slowly at first, before speeding away. A police car took up pursuit, and the SUV raced back toward San Bernardino. Then came shots from that vehicle, and a barrage of police gunfire in return. The couple ended firing at least 76 rounds, while the 21 responding police officers unleashed about 380 rounds of their own, according to Burguan. By the time the last shot rang out, the SUV was riddled with bullet holes. And Farook and Malik were inside, dead. The husband and wife didn't leave a note to explain their attack, nor did they say anything during the bloodbath, said San Bernardino's police chief. But they left behind plenty of ammunition. And explosives -- including three rudimentary devices packed with black powder and rigged to a remote-controlled toy car at the shooting site. None of these went off. The remote was found inside the SUV along with another pipe-like device, which was not an explosive, Burguan said. Hundreds of unspent rounds were discovered in the vehicle, plus two .223-caliber rifles and two pistols. All were legally purchased three to four years ago, according to Burguan. More ammunition and more bombs were found inside the couple's rented apartment in Redlands. Farook and Malik had enough firepower to do more killing. "They were equipped," the San Bernardino police chief said. "... And they could have done another attack." The center's Facebook page says it employs nearly 670 people at its facilities in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, providing service to more than 30,200 people. San Bernardino is a city of just over 200,000 people 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Authorities sift through evidence after the San Bernardino shooting.

6406	http://www.sunherald.com/news/local/crime/article56454570.html	One of two women fatally shot was pregnant, family says	One of two women fatally shot was pregnant, family saysOn Sunday, two women were fatally shot multiple times by two unknown assailants, officials said. According to Hinds County Coroner Sharon Grisham-Stewart, Janis Nicole Evans, 23, and Stephanie Denise Mejia, 29, were both pronounced dead of gunshot wounds on Ventura Drive in Jackson around 3:30 on Sunday. Two black males wearing dark clothing were seen fleeing the scene, Commander Tyree Jones said. Chief Lee Vance said one of the women was shot in the car and appears to have been shot in the back of the head with a .45-caliber weapon. The other woman was shot in the face and the chest, and the other weapon was a 9mm. Family members have told reporters that Evans was three months pregnant. If that's the case, Mississippi code dictates that the shooting of the two women becomes a triple homicide. "I feel like as a community, we lost yesterday. You've got two families who have lost loved ones, we've got at least two others that have committed crimes that are basically unspeakable, and a community that's shocked. These type crimes put fear into everybody," Vance said. "It's a serious blow for those directly involved, a serious blow for the community, a serious blow for the city." Vance said at this point police are awaiting the outcome of the autopsy to confirm the pregnancy, and that the potential unborn child has been a subject of conversation as investigators have weighed the case.

8423	http://globalgrind.com/2016/01/28/memphis-man-fatally-shot-by-police-officer-during-foot-chase/	Memphis Man Fatally Shot By Police Officer During Foot Chase	Memphis Man Fatally Shot By Police Officer During Foot ChaseA shooting in Memphis involving a police officer has gained national attention after the alleged suspect’s lifeless body was left in the street for several hours. The Commercial Appeal Memphis reports Jonathan Bratcher, and a friend were in a Chevy Impala on Wednesday when two police officers– one White, one Black– pulled them over for an unknown traffic infraction. Police claim that the two sped off and police pursued them from a distance. After crashing into another car near the St. Andrew A.M.E. Church, the men took off on foot with the officers close behind. Officials and witnesses gave contrasting accounts of what happened next. One of the men pulled out a gun and began firing at officers, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine said to reporters on Wednesday. The officers returned fire, reportedly striking Bratcher in the head. The other man, who hasn’t been identified, is still on the run. Witnesses claimed Jonathan was unarmed and his body was left behind the church for several hours before he was taken to the hospital. An off-duty Shelby County Sheriff’s Deputy, who was near the scene, also took part in the chase but did not fire his weapon. Bratcher, 32, died at the scene, writes the news outlet. Arkansas Matters reports: Investigators have not confirmed the identity of the person killed. But Mario Duncan said it was his 30-year-old brother-in-law Jonathan Bratcher. He questions what really happened. “You’re not in danger if this man done jumped out the car and ran,” said Duncan. “how is his life in danger if you done hit him with the car and threw him in handcuffs and shot him in the back of the head?” Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine told says Bratcher was not handcuffed at the time of the shooting. DeVine told reporters an investigation is currently underway. In October 2015, the city received 500 body cameras out of the 2,000 ordered for the Memphis Police Department. Jim Strickland, the city’s newly elected mayor, informed the public that the program was “suspended indefinitely” because the process was rushed. The program also included an introduction of dash cameras to squad cars. While previous outlets reported Memphis city spokeswoman Ursula Madden made statements about officers ordered to turn off their body cameras in light of the investigation, officials claim the two officers who are currently testing the new body cameras were not present when the shooting happened. Strickland released a statement about the shooting but didn’t share details behind the case. The Memphis police can release the names of the officers at their own discretion as the TBI investigates the shooting. In a statement, Mayor Jim Strickland said, “I have been made aware of an officer-involved shooting today. However, TBI is the lead agency investigating. I am not at liberty to discuss the details of this case. This is a reminder of the dangers our officers face on a daily basis, even on something as routine as a traffic stop.” Bratcher’s family has insisted he wouldn’t carry a gun due to his lengthy history with the law. In the past, he has faced charges of assault, aggravated robbery, theft and drug possession. His family confirmed he was recently released from jail and was expecting another child. Bratcher is survived by his five-year-old daughter.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-27","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2U4H12NH6Z4QL

The boy and his three siblings were waiting while their mother and stepfather stepped inside a Verizon store to pay a bill shortly before 3 p.m. CST, according to a Crossville Police Department incident report. The victim's 8-year-old brother found a loaded Taurus ACP .380 in their mother's purse, which also was left in the vehicle, police said. The child attempted to unload the semi-automatic handgun by removing the magazine and accidentally pulled the trigger. The bullet that was in the chamber was fired, striking the victim in the head, authorities said. Members of Crossville's police and fire departments and the Cumberland County Emergency Medical Services responded to the scene. According to authorities, the boy was bleeding from the head and not breathing. The boy taken to Cumberland Medical Center and then flown by medical helicopter to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, where he died Monday evening, the incident report states. The report identifies the parents as Samantha Farley, 29, and Jacob Farley, 29, both of Sparta, Tenn. Authorities have not released the name of the victim or the other children. Maj. Mark Rosser, a spokesman for the Crossville Police Department, said Tuesday he was uncertain whether the mother has a valid Tennessee handgun carry permit. Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson said Tuesday the three siblings — who also include two girls, one 9 years old and the other 4 months old — are in the care of a relative. The family has no case history with the state agency. Police were expected to forward the results of their investigation to the 13th Judicial District Attorney General's office.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":840,"startIndex":800,"value":"bullet that was in the chamber was fired"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":602,"startIndex":587,"value":"Taurus ACP .380"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":504,"startIndex":494,"value":"Crossville"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":477,"startIndex":467,"value":"3 p.m. CST"},"date":"2016-01-25","details":{"endIndex":102,"startIndex":85,"value":"Cumberland County"},"state":"Tennessee","time-day":{"endIndex":472,"startIndex":469,"value":"p.m"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":554,"startIndex":553,"value":"8"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":167,"startIndex":166,"value":"7"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2NYU9LR4NML6G

But it was unclear whether the furious shootout with the male and female suspects was the end of a daylong manhunt after the mass shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. An FBI raid was unfolding late Wednesday at an apartment in Redlands, where authorities were serving a search warrant connected to the shooting. Mass shooting The violence began around 11 a.m. at the convention building at the Inland Regional Center where employees with the county health department were attending a holiday event. Witnesses said at least two shooters opened fire, killing 14 people. Another 17 people were hurt -- many wounded by bullets from automatic-style rifles, some injured in the panic to escape. The shooters fled in a black SUV, prompting a huge police response in the area. As the hours passed, the hunt for the suspects continued with a tip taking officers to a home about 10 miles away in Redlands. When detectives followed up on it, a black SUV with Utah plates passed by slowly then sped up and raced off, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told CNN. A police car spotted it and took up pursuit. There was a shootout, the official said. The male suspect shot out of the vehicle while the woman drove. The SUV stopped a quarter a mile later, as an officer returned fire. A device that looked like a bomb also flew out of the vehicle, Meredith Davis with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS. The SUV was racing back toward San Bernardino, she said. Residents were stunned to hear the eruption of continuous gunfire. A barrage of bullets riddled the SUV's windshield. A third person who was caught running near the scene was detained, but police aren't sure whether he was connected to either shooting. Suspects dressed for assault San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan didn't say how old the suspects were or physically describe them in detail. He told reporters they were armed with assault-style rifles and handguns. A law enforcement official told CNN the rifles were AR-15s or similar style weapons. The man and the woman were dressed in what Burguan said was "assault-style clothing," describing it as "dark, kind of tactical gear." He wouldn't say if he knew if they were related. Witnessed text frightened messages Hours after the shooting, the Inland Regional Center convention center was still an active scene. The bomb squad was working to determine whether they need to blow up two suspicious devices, one of which appeared to be a pipe bomb. Survivors of the mass shooting told of hiding in offices, bathrooms and closets, texting their loved ones that they feared they were next to be shot. In the moments after the initial bloodbath, SWAT teams had scoured the facility, unsure whether the shooters were still there and looking for people hiding from the horror. Marcos Aguilera received a text from his wife who works at the Inland Regional Center. "She heard the shots and crying," he said. The situation became confusing when the fire alarm went off. "Everyone was confused," he said, relating his wife's account. A SWAT team eventually rescued his wife and two other co-workers. "When she exited the building, she said there were multiple bodies on the floor," Aguilera told CNN. The center's executive director, Lavinia Johnson, told CNN that she believed the county's Department of Public Health was having a holiday party. Johnson said the fire alarm went off in her building, and people began to evacuate but then the order came to stay in place. Later police came and took people out of their offices, marching them into the parking lot with their hands in the air. San Bernardino is a city of just over 200,000 people 60 miles east of Los Angeles.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-02","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The

Jail records show that 27-year-old Patrick Sean Carlopoli was being held Monday on multiple charges. Local media outlets report that Lee County deputies responded early Sunday morning to a 911 call from Carlopoli at Iona Lakes Apartments in Fort Myers.

9101	http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Officer-involved-shooting-on-Eau-Claires-north-side-366379171.html	NEW INFORMATION: Suspect in critical condition after officer-involved shooting	NEW INFORMATION: Suspect in critical condition after officer-involved shootingEAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) -- Eau Claire police say the suspect in Sunday night's officer-involved shooting threatened them with a knife; the suspect is currently in stable, but critical condition at a local hospital. This is the second officer-involved shooting in Eau Claire within a year's time and Eau Claire Police Chief Jerry Staniszewski says it is concerning to him the number of higher risk crimes that have been happening lately. The shooting happened on the northeast side of Eau Claire just before 9:30 p.m. on Galloway Street behind Indianhead Food Service. The Eau Claire Police had received a phone call from a business on Galloway Street, about a person who has a current arrest warrant for failing to appear in court for a previous offense of battery to an officer. “Unfortunately, the initial contact was very confrontational,” Chief Staniszewski said. “Officers weren't able to even speak to him, he pulled out a knife right away and that's what started our contact with him.” The man was located in the middle of the 2700 block of Galloway Street, pushing a grocery cart. “We were well aware of who he was, his risk factors and the type of individual he was, so we approached with caution just because we know he was and we were trying to resolve that previous court case,” Staniszewski said. Eau Claire Police say the man threatened them repeatedly with a large knife and wouldn’t respond to multiple efforts made to get him to drop the knife, including pepper spray and a Taser which were ineffective, before ultimately deciding to use lethal force. After the man was shot, officers immediately began first aid and lifesaving actions until Eau Claire Fire Rescue arrived. “There were multiple opportunities for the individual to comply, but it continued to escalate to lethal force,” Staniszewski said. “As you’re aware, we attempted nonlethal force, pepper spray and a Taser, and it finally got to a point where the officer didn't have a choice and had to use the deadly force measure to resolve it.” Staniszewski says the three officers involved are on administrative assignment until further review of the investigation; however he adds that he’s extremely confident in the decision his officers made. The suspect will remain in custody on the active arrest warrant until the investigation is done. The Wisconsin Department of Justice Criminal Division is investigating the incident. The names of all involved will not be released until interviews are completed by the DOJ, which Chief Staniszewski hopes will be by the end of this week. A man who was shot by Eau Claire Police on Sunday night is in critical but stable condition. According to a release from Eau Claire Police sent out Monday afternoon, officers approached a man in the roadway along the 2700 block of Galloway Street on Eau Claire’s north side, near the intersection with Birch Street Upon contact with the three responding police officers, the male immediately became confrontational with officers and armed himself with a large knife. The release states: “Officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to drop the knife while attempting to distance themselves from him. The suspect did not comply with the officers' commands and continued to advance toward them. Officers used less than lethal methods, including pepper spray and a Taser, in an attempt to gain compliance, however, these options were not effective.” The subject ignored officer’s commands to drop the knife and continued to move toward the officers. One of the officers then shot and struck the suspect. The release states the suspect was transported to a local hospital and is in critical, but stable condition. "I will ensure that a prompt and thorough investigation will be completed by knowledgeable and independent investigators,” Eau Claire Police Chief Jerry Staniszewski said in the release.” The investigation will include the review of officer and witness statements, squad car video, and forensic evidence. The results of the investigation will include full disclosure and citizen review." The names of the involved officers and the suspect will be released after the interviews are completed by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) -- Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting in Eau Claire, that put a male suspect in the hospital. It happened shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday on Galloway Street, just east of Hastings Way near Indianhead Food Service. Details are very limited at this point. According to police, the suspect was shot after investigators responded to reports of a wanted suspect in the area. His current condition is unclear and police have not provided any additional information about the circumstances of the shooting. "We had officers responding to a known subject to our department, who was wanted by our department," Public Information Officer Kyle Roder, with the Eau Claire Police Department said. "There was an interaction with that individual behind me on Galloway Street, just south of Birch Street, and during that interaction-- that I don't have details at this point-- one of the Eau Claire police officers shot and struck the individual, that person was transported to a local hospital." The incident brought a large police response to the area. Officers shut down Galloway Street between Hastings Place and Birch street to work the scene. That area remains closed Monday morning. "We have been working on the officer involved shooting case all night into this morning," Roder said. "We will get information out when we can." Roder says that additional information could come later Monday. EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) -- Eau Claire Police responded to an officer-involved shooting in Eau Claire shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday. Officer Kyle Roder says a male was shot and taken to a local hospital. We do not know the condition of that individual at this time. Roder said he was wanted by police. Galloway Street is blocked off to all traffic between Hastings Place and Birch Street.

9190	http://www.nbc12.com/story/30989576/now-on-nbc12-police-investigating-night-club-shooting	Police ID person killed at Richmond night club - NBC12 - WWBT - Richmond, VA News On Your Side	Police ID person killed at Richmond night club - NBC12 - WWBT - Richmond, VA News On Your SideRICHMOND, VA (WWBT) - One man is dead and two others injured after a chaotic night at a South Richmond night club. The shooting happened around 1 a.m. Monday in the Illusions Night Club at 6346 Midlothian Tpke. Police say several off-duty officers heard reports of the shooting and went inside. They found a man, identified as 21-year-old Jerquell Cheatham, dead with a gunshot wound. "It is absolutely ridiculous," said community activist James "JJ" Minor. "How in the hell did that gun get inside of the nightclub?" Two other people were injured. One was inside the club with a gunshot wound. A woman was also injured in the parking lot when she was hit by a car. Both victims were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. "There should be no discussion on this," said Minor. They just need to shut it down." A local group called Coaches Against Violence Everywhere or CAVE has organized marches and now they've taken to Facebook polling their close to 2,000 members on possibly protesting outside the club. The idea is force the club to shut down. "I can't say that that's the answer," said city council president Michelle Mosby. "We are working with the police diligently. We are working with the motel owners, and they are working with us." Keep in mind, Illusions Night Club is attached to the Richmond Inn and Suites. It was also the site of an officer involved shooting back in April. Faith leaders demanded answers after, what they call, conflicting stories on whether the suspect actually had a gun. According to police, officers have been called to the motel for five shootings, 22 violent crimes, and 156 suspicious incidents in the last four years, but police said those numbers are decreasing thanks to the cooperation of motel management. "I do not believe that the owner would spend extra dollars to hire extra officers if the intent was not to try to comply," said Mosby. Minor said he doesn't feel safe. "Not going to a club that doesn't have metal detectors," he said. "It should be mandatory. If this happened once... then guess what? Something like this is bound to happen again." There was a heavy police presence and a crowd still on the scene through 4 a.m. arguing with each other and police. Copyright 2016 WWBT NBC12.

Police say 35-year-old Thomas Ransom shot and killed 38-year-old April Ransom and another man, 43-year-old Joseph Cormier before turning the gun on himself. The shooting happened at Angie's Bar on Highway 51 in Independence. "He was sitting in the bar, he and his estranged wife spoke for a while, she got up to walk away and he followed her," said Independence Chief of Police Frank Edwards. "He shot her multiple times, went around the bar and shot a man multiple times and then turned the gun on himself" Edwards said. "We have witnesses who have heard that and we have also seen video to corroborate that." According to police, April Ransom was the estranged wife of Thomas Ransom. The relationship between April Ransom and Joseph Cormier is unknown. "All I know is that they shared an address, and we don't know anymore at this time" said Edwards. Edwards says three children, all under the age of 15, are left hanging in the balance of the shooting. "The Department of Children and Family Services has come in this morning and put in a safety plan for the kids," he said. "It's really terrible. Watching them this evening and getting them with child services... it's a terrible event," said Edwards. "She was a wonderful person, so full of life! She was like the mother hen of Angie's, everybody loved her," Angela Anthony told WAFB. "She was someone that everybody depended on and no matter what the situation was, she would always be there for you when you called on her, she always had the right words to say if you was feeling down. She will sadly be missed by so many," Anthony said. Copyright 2015 WAFB.

9299	http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/black-memphis-man-shot-dead-police-foot-chase-article-1.2512092	Black Memphis man shot dead by police during foot chase	Black Memphis man shot dead by police during foot chaseA Memphis man was shot dead by police while fleeing officers in a car and foot chase. Authorities say Jonathan Bratcher, whose death was confirmed by family on Wednesday, was one of two men who ran away from a Chevy Impala after it crashed into another vehicle during a pursuit. Memphis officers said that one of the suspects shot at them while fleeing on foot after failing to pull over for a traffic stop around 3 p.m. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is looking into the circumstances of the death, and spokesman Josh DeVine said that his organization did not know which suspect fired the shots. Investigators are still searching for the second man, who was able to run away from the scene of the death near a children’s learning center. The two officers who fired on the 32-year-old Bratcher, one of whom was white and one of whom was black, were not injured during the chase that also involved an off-duty officer who did not use his gun. Friends and family furious at the death later gathered at the area, saying that their loved one would not have carried a firearm. City officials told WREG that one of the officers was wearing a body camera and turned it off after the shooting. It was not immediately clear if footage of the incident would be released or why the camera was switched off. A witness who saw the car crash that preceded the foot chase told Fox 13 that she heard around 20 shots fired in two bursts. Bratcher had a lengthy criminal history, including charges for assault, robbery and drug possession, according to the Commercial Observer, and family said that he had recently left jail. Despite brushes with the law, those who knew him said the father of one was a good person who was expecting another child in addition to his 5-year-old. Black Lives Matter activists on Twitter also urged authorities to release more information about what led to Bratcher's death. TBI officials were tasked with looking into police-involved shootings last year after an officer shot black Memphis teenager Darrius Stewart, who the policeman said charged him. A grand jury decided not to indict the officer in the case, though it is now under review by the federal Department of Justice. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said that he was aware of Wednesday’s shooting, but could not comment on details.

The 8-year-old removed the magazine in an effort to unload the gun when it accidentally discharged, hitting his 7-year-old brother in the head. “The child removed the magazine in an effort to unload the firearm. The firearm was accidentally discharged,” police said in a press release. The child was struck in the head. The Tennessee boy, 7, killed inside a parked car at a Verizon store, was flown to a Knoxville-area hospital where he later died. Crossville police said the investigation is ongoing an they’re taking statements from everyone involved. The Cumberland County District Attorney General’s office and the Department of Children’s Services have been notified and are involved in the investigation. At the time of their release, authorities believe the incident is a tragic accidental shooting. “It’s never good to leave a gun around a kid, regardless of if it’s loaded or not,” one bystander said. Police say the family is from Sparta in White County. Neither the child nor the family has been identified by police. Sadly, children in America are often the victims of gun violence. As soon as the police investigation is complete, they’ll turn it over to a prosecutor who will determine whether the parents will face any charges. The Tennessee boy, 7, killed inside a parked car at a Verizon store, has become another statistic in gun violence. Since the deadly December 2012 rampage on Sandy Hook elementary school, at least 555 kids under the age of 12 have been killed from gunshots, both intentional and accidental, according to the analysis. Tha’s an average of just under one death of a child by firearm every two days.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-27","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A2EMDOJ3A87QTI

Fawcett says his wife, Nickey, who is Jones’ sister, called Jones’ probation officer more than two weeks before the shooting death of Danville Police Officer Thomas Cottrell. “[Nickey] wanted to keep it confidential from her family because her family would shun her for turning [Jones] in,” Fawcett said. Fawcett believes that phone call, as hard as it was to make, was ignored. After a 10TV News report on January 18 (one day after Cottrell was killed) Fawcett says investigators asked for phone records. According to the Fawcetts’ Time Warner monthly statement, on January 1, a 121-second phone call was made to the Adult Probation Office in Mount Vernon. Fawcett says his wife left almost a two-minute voicemail for Parole Officer William Baer about her brother. “She was worried about her brother with his drug activity, violence to his girlfriend, scaring his mom and him having guns,” Fawcett said. But an article in the Newark Advocate, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction says that call was never made. “[It] makes me pretty angry that the parole board would say it didn’t happen when they got the same records we have that we gave [10TV],” he said. Fawcett says the proof is on the paper. “This phone call right here could have put [Jones] back in prison,” he said, while pointing to the record printout indicating the Jan. 1 phone call. “[It would have] caused a lot of turmoil for my family, but it would have saved [Cottrell’s] life.” To the family of Officer Cottrell, Fawcett says he knows there are no words that can offer comfort, but says his family wishes to share feelings of deep condolences. “I feel for them, more than they would imagine,” he said. “My whole family does.” He also wants people to know that the alleged actions of his family member are not a reflection of his family. “We’re guilty by association,” he said. “It’s not my family’s fault. One person doesn’t speak for the whole family.” Jones has pleaded not guilty to Cottrell’s murder. WBNS-TV’s on-line public inspection file can be found on the FCC website at 10tv.com/fcc.

But underneath it all, Mr Petersen struggled to find peace. A week after Mr Petersen walked into Quakers Hill Police Station with a knife and was shot dead by police, his family have farewelled the New Zealand-born father-of-four. His children remembered their father as a best friend who taught them how to swim, ride a bike and to love unconditionally. "You only ever loved me and I am eternally grateful for everything," Mr Petersen's eldest daughter told the funeral service in Minchinbury on Wednesday. "I pray to god that you are at peace." On Tuesday, January 19, Mr Petersen's children received the news that their father had been shot dead in the foyer of the police station. Mr Petersen, known affectionately as "Uncle Dave", parked his car outside the Lalor Road station before he walked inside with a large knife and got into a confrontation with police. He was shot once by a sergeant with 24 years' experience in the force. CPR attempts were made on the 45-year-old scaffolder, who lived on nearby Highfield Road, but he died soon after. A friend of Mr Petersen's partner, Lisa, told the service, which spilled out of the chapel doors, that David's painful struggle was finally over. "... and he may finally find the peace he fought so hard to find," she said. His brother, Alex Petersen, said he wished his sibling could see all the people who loved him. He described him as a great brother, provider to his family and a "man's man". His sister, Tina, wrote in a letter read out to the service that Mr Petersen always made her laugh. "Now all I do is fight back tears," she said. "I never did tell you how much I love you and that's because I thought we would grow old together." Friends and relatives performed a moving ​haka outside the Pine Grove Memorial Park chapel before the coffin was placed into the hearse. Minister Ken Fischer said Mr Petersen's family knew the events on January 19 were completely out of character for him. He said the past few months had been particularly tough for Mr Petersen, as he battled various health issues, and his family. "He longed for peace and a way out of his troubles," he said. The Homicide Squad is carrying out a critical incident investigation into the shooting. The story Man shot dead by police at Quakers Hill remembered as 'great father, brother and friend' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":39,"startIndex":27,"value":"Quakers Hill"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-19","details":{"endIndex":979,"startIndex":960,"value":" Lalor Road station"},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1168,"startIndex":1165,"value":" 45"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":233,"startIndex":223,"value":" Petersen "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CVM8I2566ILI

(WGEM) - A Hannibal police officer will not face charges after police say he shot the passenger in a car as the driver was running from authorities last January. Police say they tried to make contact with DaMark Rudd for parole violations. But they say he got in a car and sped off. Sgt. Darrin DeLaPort, who was working security at the movie theater a block away when he responded, shot once at the drivers side window. The bullet missed Rudd. Police believe it went through Rudd's clothes before hitting his passenger, Matthew Brooks. Brooks told police he was asking Rudd to let him out of the car. Rudd took off down Main Street and crashed several blocks away on Fulton Street. Following the shooting, the Hannibal Police Department opened an investigation, as did the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Police say Sgt. DeLaPorte followed police policy in the shooting. The highway patrol released their report to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office, who stated no charges will be filed against Sgt. DeLaPorte in connection with the incident. A southeast Iowa man was arrested after being accused of throwing puppies in the trash. Five out of the nine puppies have survived so far, and the Paw Animal Shelter, in Fort Madison, is caring for them. Michael Cain, 38, of rural Montrose, faces nine counts of aggravated misdemeanor animal neglect. Lee County Sheriff Jim Sholl says the puppies were found in the trash near Cain's home. Cain faces up to two years in prison.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":124,"startIndex":116,"value":"HANNIBAL"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-22","details":{"endIndex":811,"startIndex":798,"value":"Fulton Street"},"state":"Mo","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":433,"startIndex":413,"value":"Sgt.

9622	http://kdvr.com/2015/12/02/20-victim-shooting-incident-reported-in-san-bernardino-california/	At least 14 dead in San Bernardino shooting; two suspects killed | FOX31 Denver	At least 14 dead in San Bernardino shooting; two suspects killed | FOX31 DenverSAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- It started at a holiday party -- perhaps with a slight or a testy exchange, something that prompted Syed Rizwan Farook to storm off angrily. It ended in a bloodbath with 14 people dead and 17 more wounded -- the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since Sandy Hook. At its center, a couple, Farook and Tashfeen Malik. Dressed in black, carrying semi-automatic rifles, they unleashed a massacre Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center, a facility for the developmentally disabled. That was their first brazen act. Then they led police on a chase. Farook fired while Malik drove. They died in a hail of bullets when they tried to take on 21 officers. Now comes the challenging part: What was their motive? Surely it couldn't just have been anger at a party. The level of attention speaks to something much more meticulously planned. But police don't yet know. The couple didn't leave behind a note at Inland Regional. But they did stash three explosive devices -- rigged to a remote-controlled toy car -- that didn't go off. The mass shooting It was around 11 a.m. when Farook and Malik opened fire. A text message landed in Terry Pettit's phone from his daughter, who was inside Inland Regional. "Shooting at my work. People shot," she wrote. "Pray for us. I am locked in an office." Denise Peraza was also inside the center when she was shot in the back. She called her sister Stephanie Baldwin, thinking it might be time to say goodbye. "As soon as the gunfire started, everyone dropped to the floor and they were underneath desks, and she was trying to shield herself with a chair, along with a man next to her," Baldwin told CNN affiliate KABC. "Then, all of a sudden, she said she just felt (the bullet) going through her back." "I just want to tell you that I love you," Peraza told Stephanie Baldwin over the phone through tears. Peraza survived. She is in a hospital and is expected to recover. Police have not released the names of those who died. Within minutes, troops of officers stormed the building searching for an active shooter. They counted the dead -- and shuttled the wounded out to triage. "We had to come out with our hands up and be escorted across the street to the golf course," a woman who works at the center told KCAL/KCBS. "We stood there for hours, hours witnessing clothing of deceased ones on the street, people crying, co-workers crying, us wanting to get to our children." SUV shootout But Farook and Malik slipped away in a black SUV. Not for long. Acting on information that quickly pointed police to Farook, they went to his home in Redlands with a search warrant. A black SUV drove by them. Slowly at first, then it sped away. A police car took up pursuit, as the SUV raced back in the direction of San Bernardino. While Malik drove, Farook opened fire out of the vehicle. Some 21 officers returned fire. When the SUV came to a halt, it was riddled with bullet holes. The couple inside was dead; their bodies found dressed in "assault-style clothing," San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. "Dark kind of tactical gear." One officer was wounded, but his injuries were not life-threatening, Burguan said. In the chaos, police encountered a third person who was running away. "We do not know if they were involved," Burguan said. "We have that person detained." But they feel confident that there were only two shooters -- Farook and Malik. This is notable given that, while there have been many mass shootings, it's extremely rare when they involve more than one shooter. Only two of the 28 deadliest shootings since 1949 in the United States have had more than one shooter. Guns galore Two .223 caliber rifles were in the car with them, along with two pistols. They were legally purchased, police said. Two handguns traced back to Farook, an official said. He bought them three to four years ago. Someone else bought the two rifles, possibly a former roommate -- also legally three or four years ago. That person isn't believed to have anything to do with the shootings, the official said. "I think that what we have seen and how they were equipped, there had to be some kind of planning in this," Burguan said. Explosive devices Back at Inland Regional, there was still danger to be dealt with -- three explosives the pair had left behind. They were "pipe bomb type design," Burguan said. Police secured them and remotely detonated them. The explosives had been rigged to a remote control for a toy car, an official said. That remote was found inside the SUV. And in the vehicle was another pipe-like device, but it was not an explosive, Burguan said. In Redlands, officers sent in a robot to check Farook's residence, which they held surrounded into the night. Brother-in-law shocked Farook, an American citizen, was an environmental health specialist with the San Bernardino County health department, which was hosting the holiday party at Inland Regional. He had worked there for five years. In an online profile, he described himself as a "Muslim Male living in USA/California/riverside. Religious but modern family of 4, with 2 girls and 2 boys." He "enjoys working on vintage and modern cars, reads religious books, enjoys eating out sometimes. Enjoys travelling and just hanging out in the back yard doing target practice with his younger sister and friends," his profile read. Farook's brother-in-law Farhan Khan was crushed at the news. "I have no idea why he would he do something like this. I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself," Khan said. "I don't have words to express how sad and how devastated I am." Khan said he last talked to Farook a week ago.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-02","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2EMDOJ3A87QTI

The family of the husband-and-wife shooters contacted CAIR-LA about 2 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 2, after receiving media calls about the couple’s involvement in the mass shooting. As of Thursday morning, investigators still didn’t know the motive behind the massacre carried out by Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, at the Inland Regional Center. Earlier in the day the family had been worried because, “they thought they were among the victims,” Ayloush said. “In the beginning they thought they may have been wounded or shot,” he added. “They had no clue that they could actually be the suspects.” Ayloush said Farook and his wife had been married for two years. It’s possible they met through a family network, given that she was overseas. Farook, who used to live in Riverside, had recently made the move to Redlands, he added. Ayloush has condemned the killings. “It’s important that when we face such mass shootings, to remember we blame the shooter himself or herself, not the religion or racial community as a whole,” Ayloush said. “We don’t blame all Christians ... or all white people, and rightly so,” he added. “Similarly, we should never blame a whole religion of Islam.” Keep it civil and stay on topic.

9757	http://fox17online.com/2015/12/14/bottleneck-ownership-says-weekend-shooting-was-a-hate-crime/	‘Bottleneck’ ownership says weekend shooting was a hate crime | Fox17	‘Bottleneck’ ownership says weekend shooting was a hate crime | Fox17GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — After the clerk of a Grand Rapids party store was shot over the weekend and fought back during an armed robbery, the store's manager is calling it a hate crime. The clerk, who friends and family have identified as Tony, is recovering from the armed robbery at Bottlenecks on Fuller NE on Saturday. A manager with Bottlenecks, who wished to remain anonymous, told FOX 17 the clerk saved his own life after the gunman shoved his rifle into his mouth. The manager said Tony fought back, moving the gun to his cheek just before the gunman pulled the trigger. During the struggle, the manager said, "Tony told me that (the gunman) asked him to get on his knees, and (the gunman) was saying all this vulgar stuff about him, like Tony being associated with terrorism or with ISIS." The manager told FOX 17 the gunman called the clerk a terrorist, ISIS, and said things like, "I used to kill people like you in Iraq with no problem." As of Monday afternoon, the Grand Rapids Police Department is investigating the armed robbery but Sgt. Terry Dixon said they "are not prepared to call this a hate crime." The store manager first shared harrowing surveillance video with FOX 17 on Monday morning showing the incident . It began at 11:57 p.m. Saturday, when the video shows a masked gunman armed with a rifle barging through the back door as Tony made the store's liquor order. The manager said Tony immediately put his hands up, then emptied the cash register, and gave the suspect the money. But then the suspect forced Tony to the backroom, away from surveillance cameras. The manager told FOX 17 the robber put his gun into the clerk's mouth and forced him onto his knees while saying ethnic slurs and calling Tony a "terrorist." Then Tony fought back, moving his head to the side just before the shot fired through his cheek. The manager said Tony remembered falling back, the gunman firing two more shots, and then running out the door. Surveillance shows Tony walking out of the back area holding his bleeding face, as the manager said he called 911 on his cell phone because the store's land line got kicked out. Police arrived to the store minutes later, and the manager said they are grateful Tony handled the situation bravely. "(Tony) handled it really well, he did what he was supposed to do in a robbery situation, and after I think he was very brave for doing what he did and calling the cops himself," the manager said. The manager told FOX 17 the owners are saddened by the entire incident and can't understand why Tony would be associated with terrorism: Tony is Punjabi, and has nothing to do with terrorism they said. "I don't know why (the gunman) associated him with terrorism, maybe it's because of our skin, because of what we look like, and it could happen to anyone that looks like us or has our skin tone," the manager said. "That's just the sad part because, at the end of the day, we're just normal people trying to live normal lives, we're not associated with anything like that, and it's unfair that we have to live in that fear." Police have only been able to offer a vague description of the suspect, who is believed to be a black man who is about 6 feet tall. The suspect left the store wearing a mask, black hoodie, quilted flannel shirt, and black pants. Click below for the surveillance video of the robbery. Warning - some viewers may find this disturbing. Anyone with information is asked to call Silent Observer at 616-774-2345, or the Grand Rapids Police Department at 616-456-3400. I have a hard time believing the gate crime aspect anymore. Our justice department as well as all minority groups refuse to call crimes against Christians hate crimes. They refuse to prosecute/call violence against whites hate crimes. And the almost immediately say, “it can’t be a hate crime, because it’s a robbery gone wrong.” so now we should call it on because the robbery victim is a man with a tan? Maybe and likely, its a robbery and the victim added the hot fudge sugar coating on the story to make it more. We’ve seen tons of added flavor later, often it’s a completely fake story (like the Kkk at colleges). We have cair coming out as fast as sharpton comes out calling for mass attention to a certain crime (often fabricated). People burning their own churches and businesses, busting their own Windows, vandalizing their own cars, to fake hate crimes, gain attention and money, while blaming a politician or entire race. No, because the shooter specifically said he killed people “like him” with no problem. DId you read this? If a guy runs into a store owned by a white man and says “DEATH TO THE WHITE MAN” and shoots him, it will most definitely be ruled a hate crime or an act of terrorism.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2015-12-12","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A14F0F0LNL6GT

While on the scene of a shooting, Baltimore officers were called to a nearby police-involved shooting in Southwest Baltimore on Wednesday night. The nonfatal police-involved shooting happened about 30 minutes after a non-fatal shooting that left a 32-year-old soda delivery man wounded around 6:20 p.m. after an attempted armed robbery. While officers were on the shooting scene at Linnard St. by Harlem Ave., they heard discharging coming from several blocks away in the area of N. Hilton Street and Edmondson Ave. When officers neared the crime scene, two armed suspects began to run away. One of the suspects escaped while the other was chased by officers. Police noted that the suspect had a handgun and ordered him to drop his weapon. When the suspect refused, Officer Charles Smith fired his departmental gun, striking the suspect in the leg. Rogers still resisted arrest until he was ultimately taken into custody and transported to a local hospital. He is currently being held at Central Booking. The Special Investigation Response Team responded and police recovered the suspect's weapon and a second weapon that was close to the area where the first suspect ran.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":115,"startIndex":105,"value":"BALTIMORE "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":549,"startIndex":541,"value":"6:20 p.m"},"date":"2015-12-16","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44
10231	http://mashable.com/2016/02/08/chicago-cop-suing-teenager-estate/	Chicago cop shoots teenager, then sues victim's family for emotional trauma	Chicago cop shoots teenager, then sues victim's family for emotional traumaA Chicago police officer who fatally shot a 19-year-old and his neighbor is suing the teenager's estate, alleging that the December shooting caused the officer "extreme emotional trauma." Officer Robert Rialmo seeks more than $10 million in damages in what is technically a countersuit. The father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier filed a wrongful death suit after the shooting. "That's a new low for the Chicago Police Department," said Basileios Foutris, the lawyer for LeGrief's father. LeGrier called 911 three times in the early morning of Dec. 26 to tell the dispatcher someone was threatening to kill him, though he didn't specify who. The first dispatcher hung up on LeGrier, and he had to call back twice before a third caller sent a police car to check out the situation. LeGrier's father, Antonio, also called 911 that morning to tell police that his son had a baseball bat and was trying to break into his room. What happened after Rialmo arrived is somewhat unclear. Rialmo said the teenager twice swung at his head with a baseball bat just outside the apartment complex. Rialmo then fired eight times, killing LeGrier and LeGrier's neighbor, Bettie Jones. Jones was standing behind LeGrier when a bullet ripped through him and hit her in the chest. Antonio LeGrier said his son was inside the building when Rialmo opened fire, and that his son was not threatening the officer. The teenager had been acting strangely for several months before the fatal encounter, according to police at Northern Illinois University, where LeGrier was an engineering student. He had shouted profanities at his dorm cafeteria and then hit a cafeteria employee when she asked to see his student ID. When police came to arrest him, he told them "I am God." LeGrier also chased after a female student and, when stopped by police, again said "I am God." He also told them he was in "outer space." The city of Chicago has tried to clean up the image of its police since November, when the city was court-ordered to release video of former officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times during on Oct. 20, 2014. The Chicago police superintendent resigned as a result and there have been calls for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to do the same. Have something to add to this story?

Martinez lived with his family about three blocks from the riverbed area where he was shot, but investigators found no evidence of a problem at his home, Mendoza said. Investigators believe Martinez had ties to a gang in Hawaiian Gardens, but they don't know if the shooting was gang related, Mendoza said. They also don't know if the man he was seen with was a friend or a foe. "The African American male is a person of interest we would like to talk to," Mendoza said, "but we haven't identified any suspects as of yet." Investigators searched the riverbed area looking for evidence of another victim, but found nothing, Mendoza said. "The two of them ran in there together," he said, "so it's kind of mysterious." Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau at (323) 555-8900. Those wishing to be anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.

Investigators became aware of the incident at 8:25 p.m. when the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department received a call about a gunshot victim outside a liquor store. When deputies arrived, they discovered Harris, who had been shot multiple times in the lower leg, and a 19-year-old male, who had been shot once in the shoulder, Det. Todd Anderson said. Witnesses said the 19-year-old, a local gang member, had just walked out of the store and was having a conversation with Harris, who was standing outside, when two black men walked up to the pair and began shooting. Anderson said investigators suspect the shooters were rival gang members and the 19-year-old had been the target. However, there was so much gunfire that a stray bullet went through the rear window of a passing car, narrowly missing the driver and his two small children inside. The 4-year-old boy was treated at a local hospital for cuts from flying glass, but the child and his 1-year-old sibling were otherwise unhurt, Anderson said. “They were really lucky they weren’t killed. It’s because they were small; if they had been taller they would have been hit.” Harris and the 19-year-old were taken to a nearby hospital. The 19-year-old was treated for his injuries and is expected to survive. Harris, a Los Angeles resident, was pronounced dead at 8:56 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

11287	http://homicide.latimes.com/post/adrian-simental/	Adrian Simental, 24 - The Homicide Report - Los Angeles Times	Adrian Simental, 24 - The Homicide Report - Los Angeles TimesAdrian Simental, a 24-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a police officer Sunday, June 21, in the 500 block of East Lee Drive in Azusa, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records. The incident began at 12:52 p.m., when Simental’s family called the Azusa Police Department to report that he was acting bizarrely and had injured himself, said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Det. Holly Francisco. A short while later, the police received another report that Simental was breaking into the neighbor’s house next door. He broke out several windows, Francisco said, and entered the house through one of the windows. Neighbors also reported hearing a female screaming inside the house, Francisco said. One Azusa officer entered the house and found Simental at the back door, Francisco said, “and then the officer-involved shooting happened.” Simental was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:38 p.m., according to coroner’s records. As it turned out, Francisco said, no one was in the home but Simental. “We don’t know what the screaming was,” she said. “It might have been him, but we really don’t know.” At least two neighbors have said on television reports that they saw Simental in the backyard screaming, “Shoot me, shoot me!” before he was shot multiple times by the officer. “Those are obviously witness statements,” Francisco said, “but I’m not putting that out there. We won’t know until the interview why the officer decided to fire on him.” The officer has not been identified. Francisco said he has been with the Azusa Police Department about eight years. Investigators did not find a gun by Simental after he was shot, Francisco said. There were tools near where he fell, she said, but sheriff’s investigators don’t know what, if any, role they played in the shooting. The Sheriff’s Department investigates all homicides for the Azusa Police Department, including officer-involved shootings. Francisco said her investigators have not been able to interview the Azusa officer yet, so they don’t yet know what happened when he went inside. East Lee Drive is a tree-lined street with small, well-kept houses, just a couple blocks away from Azusa High School. The street was quiet the morning of June 23, except for the hum of the equipment cleaning inside the house where Simental was shot. The owners have moved into a motel until the house has been cleaned and repaired, one of the workers said. Drops and smears of dried blood created a spotty trail from the house where Simental lived to the fence of the house next door, where he died. Family members politely turned down requests for an interview, but later that evening, Simental's sister, Jossie, texted information about the Adrian Simental Memorial Funeral Fund . Jossie Simental also provided a photo of her brother with long hair, the way he always wore it until very recently, when he cut it short. "My brother attended East L.A.

Fabian was shot inside the office of his business, the A-1 Diamond Touch Body Shop, said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Lt. Eddie Hernandez. Deputies were called to the scene about 12:13 p.m. A couple of employees were working in the shop, Hernandez said, but Fabian was alone in the office when he was shot. Witnesses told investigators they saw an adult male walk into the office and then heard multiple gunshots. After the shooting, the shooter walked out of the business and was last seen walking east in an alley, Hernandez said. Fabian was pronounced dead at the scene at 12:22 p.m. with multiple gunshot wounds, according to coroner’s records. The employees told investigators that the assailant had come to the business before, looking for Fabian when he was away, Hernandez said. “This was not a robbery,” he said. “These men knew each other. We believe the suspect’s specific intent was to find the victim and kill him.” Hernandez said the employees did not get a good look at the shooter. Their only description was a Latino in his 20s. Investigators are trying to find out more about Fabian’s background and past business dealings to try to identify the suspect.

Denny Michael De Silva was convicted of the murder of 20-year-old Romario Green, who died after being shot in the chest and throat during an incident in north-west London in July last year. An argument had taken place in Fishers Way in Wembley involving De Silva and Mr Green and a number of others late in the evening on July 1, police said. Shortly after midnight a car carrying De Silva drove slowly past Mr Green and his friends in Harrow Road, which they chased and threw a bottle at. When the car sped back Mr Green ran towards it and was hit by a single shot. He died at the scene. The vehicle, a Ford Focus, was later found burnt out in Luton. De Silva was tracked down to Malaga in Spain a month later after European arrest warrants were issued for him and another suspect who had fled the country. De Silva, 23, of Westbourne Park Road, London, was sentenced at the Old Bailey on Wednesday, having been extradited back to the UK in August last year. Detective Inspector Julie Willats, from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, paid tribute to Mr Green's family for encouraging people in the local community to support the police investigation. Ms Willats said: "A young man lost his life and incidents such as this underline the need for the people to call time on those illegally possessing weapons and contact the police or Crimestoppers. The information you hold may just save someone's life.

Long Beach police officers were called to the apartment building about 8:30 a.m. regarding a possible domestic violence incident in progress, and found Owens lying in an alley outside the building, according to a department news release. Owens was pronounced dead at the scene with multiple gunshot wounds to her head, according to coroner records. Witnesses told investigators that a man shot Owens and then left the scene with a toddler before officers arrived, according to the news release. An officer arriving at the scene noticed a man who matched the suspect’s description at an apartment building one block away, in the 1800 block of Chestnut Avenue, according to the release. The officers surrounded the building and forced entry into the apartment to rescue the boy, whom they feared was in danger, according to the release. The child was unharmed and put in the custody of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Two male adults were detained when the boy was rescued, but investigators said they didn’t know the relationship between the men, the child and Owens. NBC4 News interviewed neighbors, who said the toddler and suspect lived with Owens in the apartment building, and that neighbors spotted the child running naked after the shooting. One of the men, Eric Jerome Williams Jr., a black, 29-year-old resident of Long Beach, was arrested on suspicion of murder. Williams was charged with murder, child abuse, being a felon in possession of a handgun and injuring a child's parent, according to a spokeswoman from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

(KOIN) — One person was killed and 2 others were injured in a shooting early Saturday morning.

Demarcus Spencer, 40, was killed in the shooting. An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday. Dwayne Bates, 41, and Jason Burk, 35, were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson said witnesses reported hearing more than 2 dozen gunshots. Witnesses also described a disturbance that led to the exchange of gunfire but officers don’t know what that was. The shooting happened both inside and outside the club. According to Sgt. Simpson there was a function inside the club, but it is not clear how many people were in attendance. Many of the people left after the shooting, and police would like to speak with them. It is unclear if the victims are part of the club or if they are related to each other in any way. North Precinct officers are familiar with the club because of frequent calls for service, including a previous shooting, Sgt. Simpson said. No suspects have been identified at this time.

Police say that Zdzislaw Golabek, 37, was found at his apartment on 45th Street in Sunset Park around 8 p.m. Saturday night. He had a gunshot wound to his head, and was declared dead at the scene. Cops initially were investigating reports that Golabek and his friend, 32-year-old Maciej Gorecki, had been playing Russian roulette during the snowstorm. They say that turned out to be a false report. Instead, Gorecki has now been charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon in Golabek's death. "My feeling was like, I can't believe it,” the victim's brother, fellow Brooklyn resident Andrzej Golabek, told the Post. "I still can’t believe it. He was really quiet. He never got into trouble." As Mayor de Blasio detailed earlier, at least three other people died during last night's blizzard, all while shoveling snow.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":162,"startIndex":154,"value":"blizzard"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-01-24","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said that Sherrod Stuart and his partner were "respond[ing] to numerous 911 calls reporting a large fight in the street with guns, bats, and knives at 2505 3rd Avenue." The incident occurred at around 2:10 a.m., and Stuart is now recovering at Lincoln Hospital. Bratton said at press conference: As the officers arrived at the scene, they encountered a male subject and pursued him. As backup units arrived the officers engaged in a gunfight during which Police Officer Stuart was struck in the right foot. He returned gunfire, striking the male suspect four times. A .380 semi-automatic firearm was recovered at the scene. Three additional firearms were recovered in a subsequent search of the area around 137th Street and 3rd Avenue where the initial 911 calls came in. Bratton identified the suspect as Christopher Rice, 19, and said that the investigation so far "indicates that this subject has a criminal history of five prior arrests, including an arrest just yesterday on a charge of fare beating, a charge in which he was released from court at 11p.m. last night—three hours before the shooting." The police released an image of Stuart, 25, smiling and giving two thumbs up from his hospital bed during Commissioner Bratton's visit. A resident told the Daily News that a party had gotten out of control, "There was arguing and then there was screaming. A cop came by and then there were shots." A worker in the area said he heard around "15 shots." Mayor Bill de Blasio, who attended the press conference along with Patrolmens Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, said, "This young man as you heard, just four years on the job, he already has a very, very impressive career in terms of the work he's done, getting to the anti-crime unit.

The incident began at 5:24 p.m. when the Downey Police Department received 911 calls about shots fired in the parking lot behind a large apartment complex, Sgt. Kevin McCaster said. Shortly thereafter, the department also received reports about a gray Toyota Yaris that collided with parked cars near the shooting scene. When officers arrived, they found Araujo lying in the parking lot, McCaster said. Araujo, who lived in Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:26 p.m. with multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, according to coroner’s records. The officers stopped two other men a short distance from the crashed Yaris, McCaster said. One had a gunshot wound, and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. The two men were arrested on suspicion of a probation violation, McCaster said. Witnesses reported that a third male adult also ran from the Yaris, but officers couldn’t find him, McCaster said. Investigators found drugs and multiple weapons at the scene, but McCaster said he couldn’t provide details about how many or what kind. Investigators are also trying to determine how the men knew each other, he said, and what they were doing in the parking lot. "I can say there was some sort of gathering at the rear of the complex, between multiple male individuals, during which time an altercation took place, one man was killed, another was injured and people fled the area,” McCaster said. “It was a shootout, but who was shooting at whom we’re still trying to determine." The case is still under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call Det. Paul Hernandez at (562) 904-2368. Those wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.

So tell me again why you pulling the race card when Caucasians do the same as African American. Merry Christmas This happened at the other end of the shopping center. It wasn’t in front of Wal-Mart, just happened to be in the parking lot Wal-Mart shares with many other stores. My family and I were pulling into the parking lot shortly after this happened.
