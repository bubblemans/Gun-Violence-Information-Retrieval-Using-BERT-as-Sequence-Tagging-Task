Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller says Tiana Carruthers, a 25-year-old mother, was with several children outside an apartment complex when alleged gunman Jason Dalton approached her, Fox17 reports. She told the kids to run inside and was shot three times when he opened fire. "You look at where bullets ended, looking where the victims were and looking where the suspect vehicle was, I truly believe her actions were very courageous and likely led to the saving of some children's lives," the sheriff says. Carruthers was hospitalized with gunshot wounds in the shoulder, hip, and leg. Dalton, an Uber driver, went on to kill six people and critically injure another, police say.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":18,"startIndex":9,"value":"Kalamazoo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-20","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":110,"startIndex":105,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":374,"startIndex":362,"value":"Jason Dalton"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":269,"startIndex":267,"value":"25"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":263,"startIndex":247,"value":"Tiana Carruthers"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A3LD1G3R5NOVYH

Carruthers was hit three times in the legs and arms, according to WWMT, but is expected to survive after receiving multiple surgeries. Thanks to Carruthers, no children at the apartment complex were injured because she put herself in between the gunman and the children. Uber confirmed that Mr Dalton passed the background check to become a driver, and admitted it received several complaints about the killer, one specifically citing "erratic" driving. Investigators seized 15 guns - 11 long guns and four handguns - from the house of Jason Brian Dalton, the Cooper Township man accused of killing six people Saturday during a deadly shooting spree in Kalamazoo, an official from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said. According to Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller, she "sensed trouble" and sent the kids inside as quickly as possible. Carruthers was able to provide a description of the man who shot her, as well as his vehicle. She was asking 'Joi, help me. The gunman reportedly continued his shooting rampage a few hours later, killing six and injuring two, including a 14-year-old girl. He would then fatally shoot Mary Lou Nye, 60, Mary Joe Nye, 62, Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Dorothy Brown, 74, at a nearby Cracker Barrel, officials said. The 45-year-old is being held without bail after being charged with six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was also baffled by Dalton's post-arrest demeanor.

It happened around 9:30 at the Cedar Valley Townhouses on the SW side. 25-year-old Joseph Perkins Jr. of Chicago died and another man was taken to the hospital with a gun shot wound to the leg. In January alone this year there were 14 reports of shots fired in Cedar Rapids. That number is up from 10 in January of 2015 and way up from just 3 in 2014. "January's numbers were concerning that they were high, comparatively speaking a little bit higher than last January which were high," said Police Chief Wayne Jerman this afternoon. February so far has had just four reports, but one of them most recently includes a murder. Shootings have happened in all different parts of the city, so it's hard for Cedar Rapids Police to target just one area. Police believe the reason for that is because in general the shootings are not random, but targeted for whatever reason. Many who have moved to the city say the violence is relative, like Erica Coxhead, a Coe College student who recently moved from Illinois. "I've heard the city being called "crapids" and I was kind of shocked by that because I don't see, I don't feel unsafe in this city, I don't, when I step off campus I don't necessarily feel unsafe," said Coxhead. Police say while Cedar Rapids is a mid-sized city, it's experienced some urban violence. The police department announced their new Police Community Action Team or P-CAT a little more than a month ago. The team was created to address violence in the city, we are told they were not scheduled to work at the time of Tuesday night's shooting. Police consider a shots fired incident whenever shell casings are found, property is damaged, or there is a victim due to a gun discharging. We are told multiple people were interviewed following Tuesday night's homicide, police are confident it was not random. Sen. Charles Grassley is defending his party's refusal to consider a U.S. Supreme Court nominee saying he doesn't care if he even shows up in the history books much less whether he's viewed favorably as chairman of the powerful judiciary committee.

Police said that 17-year-old De’Monte Ty’Juan Douglas and a 14-year-old male are responsible for shooting the puppy 18 times with a BB gun. Officials say that both teens live at the apartment complex where the puppy was found off Springdale Road Sunday. Since the arrests, hundreds of people have responded with interest in adopting the pup. Despite being shot more than a dozen times with a BB gun, doctors say the puppy, named Brody, appears to be on track to a full recovery. Aside from several gaps in his fur, Brody is back to doing what puppies should be doing, according to Jay Hreiz, a Veterinarian at Ebenezer Animal Hospital, who is caring for Brody. “We find BBs in dogs all the time and they generally don’t cause a big issue,” Hreiz said. “They’re inert, they’re not moving, they’re not puncturing organs or making him overtly uncomfortable.” Hospital personnel say no more applications will be accepted for Brody’s adoption, and they hope that process takes place in the next couple of days. “It’s just been an overwhelming amount of support and you know it was a very sad beginning, but I think it’s going to be a very happy ending for him,” said Hreiz. The two teens face cruelty to animals in the first degree and if convicted can face up to five years in prison.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":312,"value":"18 times"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":334,"startIndex":328,"value":"BB gun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":75,"startIndex":66,"value":"ROCK HILL"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-21","details":{"endIndex":441,"startIndex":426,"value":"Springdale Road"},"state":"SC - South Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":215,"startIndex":213,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":249,"startIndex":225,"value":"De\u2019Monte Ty\u2019Juan Douglas"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":258,"startIndex":256,"value":"14"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":142,"startIndex":132,"value":"6-week-old"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	AQ4NUYZWCDZ73

(AP) - The Latest on the shootings in the Kalamazoo, Michigan, area (all times local): 1:50 p.m. Uber says the man suspected of going on a shooting rampage that left six people dead was one of its drivers. But spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian would not say whether 45-year-old Jason Dalton was driving for the ride-sharing service on Saturday when the shootings occurred outside an apartment complex, a car dealership and a restaurant. Uber's Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan says the company is "horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence" and that Uber has contacted police to offer assistance in the investigation. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says authorities are investigating a Facebook post that the suspect was an Uber driver who was driving erratically around the time of the shootings. He would not elaborate because of the ongoing investigation. Uber also released its firearms policy that prohibits both drivers and passengers from carrying firearms in an Uber vehicle. 1:30 p.m. The next-door neighbor of a woman shot first in a rampage that left six people dead says she and her family heard the shooting, ran outside and her neighbor "was on the ground." Tammy George tells The Associated Press that four bullets went into a closet of her apartment, where her son was playing video games with two friends a few feet away. George says her neighbor was lucky to be alive considering the number of shell casings authorities found. The woman has not been identified. Police say she was shot multiple times and was seriously wounded in the rampage that began about 6 p.m. Saturday outside the apartment complex on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County. George says she made sure the woman's children were OK and told them that their mother was talking and asking about them. Forty-five-year-old Jason Dalton of Kalamazoo County was arrested early Sunday in Kalamazoo in connections with the shootings. 12:40 p.m. Authorities have released the names of four people killed inside two vehicles parked near a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Kalamazoo during a shooting rampage that left six people dead. Michigan State Police say the victims were 62-year-old Mary Lou Nye of Baroda and 60-year-old Mary Jo Nye, 68-year-old Barbara Hawthorne and 74-year-old Dorothy Brown, all of Battle Creek. A 14-year-old girl also shot in the restaurant lot remains in critical condition. State police say four of the victims were inside a Chevrolet Cruze and the fifth victim - Mary Lou Nye - was alone in an Oldsmobile minivan nearby. The shooting happened shortly before 10:30 Saturday night and was the last of three separate shootings. The suspect in the shootings, 45-year-old Jason Dalton, has been taken into custody. 12:15 p.m. A Michigan prosecutor says authorities are investigating a Facebook post that the suspect in a series of random shootings that left at least six people dead was an Uber driver who was driving erratically around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he is aware of the post regarding 45-year-old Jason Dalton of Kalamazoo County. Getting added that it is part of the investigation, but he was not prepared to discuss it. Getting says Dalton likely will face multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder in connection with the shootings Saturday. Dalton is expected to appear Monday before a judge in a Kalamazoo County courtroom. He was arrested early Sunday in Kalamazoo. Uber did not immediately comment but a spokesman says they are preparing a statement. 10:50 a.m. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder says "the victims and their families - and the entire Kalamazoo area - should be in everyone's thoughts" after a shooting rampage that killed at least six people. Prosecutor Jeff Getting says 45-year-old Jason Dalton likely will face multiple first-degree murder and attempted murder counts. Dalton was arrested early Sunday. The shootings started Saturday evening outside an apartment complex where a woman was seriously wounded. A father and son were slain four hours later at a car dealership. Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded 15 minutes later in a restaurant parking lot. Snyder in his statement Sunday also lauded police, saying "their actions resulted in the suspect being caught before he was able to harm anyone else through these senseless and apparently random acts of violence." 8:55 a.m. Authorities expect the suspect believed to be responsible for a series of random shootings in western Michigan that left at least six people dead will be arraigned Monday afternoon. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says 45-year-old Jason Dalton of Kalamazoo County likely will face multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder when he appears before a judge in a Kalamazoo County courtroom.

At least four people have died and another 20 have been injured in a mass shooting that took place around 5 p.m. HESSTON, Kan. — A gunman armed with an "assault-style" weapon drove through a south-central Kansas town Thursday, taking shots at people, before storming the factory where he worked. Authorities said he killed three people and wounded 14 before being shot dead by an officer. Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said all the dead were shot inside Excel Industries, a plant in Hesston that makes lawn mower products. He said 14 were injured in the shootings, 10 critically. A law enforcement officer killed the gunman after he began shooting at police, Walton said. Walton would not identify the suspect or discuss a motive but said there were "some things that triggered this individual." The shootings began about 5 p.m. when the gunman was in a car and shot a man on the street, wounding him in the shoulder. A short time late, another person was shot in the leg at an intersection. "The shooter proceeded north to Excel Industries in Hesston, where one person was shot in the parking lot before he opened fire inside the building," the department said in a release. "He was seen entering the building with an assault-style long gun." A Hesston officer responding to the scene exchanged fire with the shooter, who was killed. The officer who killed the shooter was not injured. Walton said about 150 people were likely in the plant at the time of the shooting, and that the law enforcement officer who killed the suspect "saved multiple, multiple lives." He said the gunman also had a pistol. The officer who killed the man is "a hero as far as I'm concerned," Walton said. Erin McDaniel, spokeswoman for the nearby city of Newton, said the suspect was known to local authorities. She wouldn't elaborate. The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Michigan, leaving six people dead and two severely wounded. Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm. Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran. Shooting"I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company," Espinoza said. "After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him." A nearby college was briefly locked down. Several law enforcement vehicles surrounded the suspect's home in a trailer park in Newton. The Harvey County Sheriff's Department initially said authorities believed the suspect's roommate could be inside. But McDaniel said the standoff ended later Thursday night and no one was inside the home. Hesston is a community of about 3,700 residents about 35 miles north of Wichita. Excel Industries was founded in Hesston in 1960. The company manufactures Hustler and Big Dog mowing equipment and was awarded the Governor's Exporter of the Year award in 2013 from the Kansas Department of Commerce. Gov. Sam Brownback issued a statement late Thursday, calling the shootings "a tragedy that affects every member of the community." Walton said the FBI and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation had been called in to assist. A spokeswoman for the Kansas City office of the FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday night. "This is just a horrible incident. ... There's going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over," Walton said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":342,"startIndex":321,"value":"\"assault-style\"

Police say a former Stockton police officer allegedly died at the hands of 59-year-old Rafael Watts Tuesday morning. Now the department is piecing together exactly what caused the confrontation. An autopsy completed Wednesday afternoon showed Laurits "Pepe" Petersen was not only allegedly stabbed by Watts but also shot. The brutal death of the 75-year-old former homicide detective hit the department hard. "He still kept in contact with homicide victims' families. He would visit them on Christmas and birthdays and bring them presents. That tells you the type of person who we lost. It's a sad day here at the PD," said Joe Silva, spokesperson for the Stockton Police Department. Investigators said Watts stabbed and shot Petersen on Tam O' Shanter Drive across from Cortez Park. A good Samaritan who jumped in to break up the attack was also stabbed, but was not shot. Watts left the scene of the attack armed with a gun, according to investigators. That's when a K-9 caught up to him and bit him. The suspect is at the San Joaquin County jail and is facing homicide charges. Police don't know if Petersen and Watts knew each other or what led to the altercation. They're calling on witnesses for help. The good Samaritan is a 59-year-old man. He's being treated for his injuries at an area hospital but is expected to survive.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":84,"startIndex":75,"value":"Stockton "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-25","details":{"endIndex":932,"startIndex":921,"value":"Cortez Park"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":386,"startIndex":376,"value":"afternoon "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":232,"startIndex":224,"value":" 59-year"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":250,"startIndex":237,"value":"Rafael Watts "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":503,"startIndex":495,"value":" 75-year"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":416,"startIndex":393,"value":"Laurits \"Pepe\" Petersen"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1389,"startIndex":1382,"value":"59-year"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	AVT70WXOWRHGI

200	http://www.wistv.com/story/31270153/2-nypd-officers-shot-in-confrontation-with-gunman	2 NYPD officers shot in confrontation with gunman	2 NYPD officers shot in confrontation with gunmanNEW YORK (AP) - Two police officers were shot in a confrontation with a gunman who slammed his car into a police vehicle early Saturday, in the second on-duty shooting of multiple officers in the nation's biggest city this month, police said. Officers William Reddin and Andrew Yurkiw were in stable condition after the 3:30 a.m. encounter, which happened as multiple officers converged and fired at an armed driver who had pointed a gun at some of the officers, fled and then rammed a police car, Police Commissioner William Bratton said. Police were investigating how many officers fired and the exact sequence of events, including whether police themselves fired any of the shots that injured their colleagues. It's standard for police shooting investigations to look into the possibility of what's known as "friendly fire," and Saturday's shooting unfolded in what Bratton described as "a complex crime scene" involving eight officers and suspect Jamal Funes. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Yurkiw and Reddin were alert and expected to recover. "These are very dedicated officers who were out there protecting us," de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Funes, 34, was in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds, Bratton said. Officers found a .357 Magnum revolver on the front seat of his car, with five spent shell casings in the gun, the police commissioner said. He said police were trying to determine what might have prompted Funes' conduct. A spokesman for the New York Police Department said investigators have notified the FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force about the incident but are unaware of any ties Funes may have to terrorism. A spokeswoman for the FBI did not immediately return a call for comment Saturday night. It wasn't immediately clear whether Funes, who police said had previously used the name Fredrick Funes, had a lawyer who could comment on his behalf. No working telephone number for Funes' family could immediately be found. Records obtained by The Associated Press show Fredrick Funes was released from state prison in 2010 and has served about three years behind bars after being convicted of attempted assault in Brooklyn. A police spokesman confirmed the records are those of the man they have in custody. The shooting came a little more than two weeks after Officers Diara Cruz and Patrick Espeut were shot and wounded on patrol in a public housing stairwell by a gunman who killed himself soon after, police said. Last month, Officer Sherrod Stuart was wounded in the ankle in what police later determined was a friendly-fire shooting as another officer exchanged gunfire with a suspect in a Bronx street brawl. In October, Officer Randolph Holder was shot and killed by a suspected bicycle thief he was chasing. Yurkiw, an officer for three years, was hit in his bulletproof vest - 27 years after such a vest also saved his father, former Officer Paul Yurkiw. "It's like I'm going through this all over again," Paul Yurkiw told the Daily News. "Without the vest, me or him and a lot of other police officers wouldn't be walking on this planet right now." Reddin, who participated in a gun arrest only Friday, was shot in the hip, authorities said. Reddin, a nine-year police veteran, was part of a harrowing arrest in the same part of Brooklyn in 2011, when his partner, Sgt. Michael Miller, struggled with a suspect over a gun. Miller's finger, wedged between the gun's hammer and cylinder, prevented the suspect from pulling the trigger, according to news reports at the time. Bratton said the confrontation started when two uniformed housing police officers - not Yurkiw and Reddin - heard gunfire near an intersection in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. As they approached Funes, he pointed a revolver and fled, and they followed and radioed for help. Driving the wrong way down a street, Funes rammed a responding, marked police car, Bratton said. He said Reddin and Yurkiw, in plainclothes, were in another car on the scene as multiple officers opened fire. Funes was still in his car when he was shot, Bratton said. This story has been corrected to show first name of the suspect is Jamal, not James, according to the New York Police Department. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Authorities were not looking for anyone else, and a gun was found near the bodies, she said. less A Phoenix police officer, left, tries to give instructions to parents waiting to reunite with their children, Friday, Feb. 12, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz. after two teens were shot Friday at Independence High School in the Phoenix suburb. Glendale Officer Tracey Breeden told reporters Friday that both victims were 15 years old and were shot once. She says authorities are not searching for any suspects and a weapon was found near the bodies. Breeden told parents awaiting word on their kids that "your children are safe." less GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Two 15-year-old girls died Friday in a shooting at a suburban Phoenix high school that initially caused panic among parents who could not reach their children but later emerged as a murder-suicide. Police announced that a suicide note was found at the shooting scene near the cafeteria area of Independence High School in Glendale. They said the girls each were shot once, were declared dead at the scene and a weapon was found near the bodies. "Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appeared to also be in a relationship," Glendale police spokeswoman Tracey Breeden said in a statement Friday afternoon. Breeden said it is believed nobody witnessed the shooting. Both teens have been identified, but Breeden said "their names will not be confirmed or released at this time by the police department due to their juvenile status." Hours before the lockdown of the school was lifted, hundreds of worried parents crowded the parking lots of nearby discount and convenience stores. One woman gnawed on her fingernails as she spoke on a cellphone, while another had tears streaming down her face. Other parents chain-smoked as they waited for news. Cheryl Rice said she went to a store after a friend called about the shooting and asked about Rice's 15-year-old daughter. But the girl called to say she was safe as Rice arrived at the store. She said it was horrible waiting for word about her child. "You don't know if it's your daughter or not. You don't know who's being bullied. You don't know who is being picked on. You don't know anything. It could be anybody," Rice said. Lanie Walter, who is a senior at the school, heard ambulances on her way to campus but didn't think much of it until her first class was locked down. When she called her parents to tell them she was safe, "my mom was actually really relieved because she was watching it on the news," she said. Parents were bused to the school to be reunited with their children. Some cut through a nearby field as they rushed toward their kids in emotional reunions. Other students who got permission from their parents left campus on their own. The Glendale Union High School District alerted parents to the shooting through emails and automatic phone calls and released information on social media, Superintendent Brian Capistran said. Students typically are not allowed to use their cellphones during lockdowns, but as calls from parents flooded the district, officials asked teachers to have students call family, Capistran said. Social workers and counselors will be available to students and staff when school resumes Tuesday, the superintendent said. Minnie Kramer, mother of a 15-year-old student, said she rushed out of work when she got a text from her son right after the shooting, telling her that he was OK. As she waited to be reunited with her son, Kramer said she worried about whether any of his friends were harmed. "I know that my son is OK, but, emotionally, you don't know what it does, especially at 15, especially if it's someone he knew," Kramer said.

Nearly two decades later, Craw­ford’s death remains a mystery to law enforcement. According to Augusta Chronicle archives, police found the teenager’s body just before 3:30 a.m. off Conniston Drive. He had been shot with a handgun, said Investigator Dewayne Piper of the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies had responded to a call about gunshots in the area when they found the body. Someone who called 911 told emergency dispatchers about seeing two men walk into the woods, but after several shots were fired, only one walked out. Investigators told The Chronicle in 1998 that they were unsure of a motive. At the time of his death, Crawford was on probation for a 1997 incident in which he and two other youths were charged with holding up Comedy House Theatre on Wash­ington Road. Crawford, who was a senior at West­side High, was indicted in March 1997 on charges of burglary, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime and three counts of armed robbery. As part of a plea negotiation, the charges were reduced to three counts of robbery by force, and Crawford was sentenced in August 1997 to 20 years of probation. The judge ordered him to spend the first year in the detention center. At the time of his death, Crawford was ALREADY on probation for a 1997 FELONY for holding up Comedy House Theater on Wash­ington Road. By the time he was a High School Senior, was arrested for and indicted for burglary, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime and three counts of armed robbery. A plea deal got him 1 years in the lockup and 20 years of probation. maybe RCSO should focus on unsolved murders where the victims were CITIZENS and worry about the self cleaning Thug vs Thug events when they are finished with those.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":87,"startIndex":72,"value":"Eugene Crawford"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":376,"startIndex":368,"value":"3:30 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Here's what we know about the attacks. Authorities said a gunman shot eight people in three different parts of the county on Feb. 20. Around 5:42 p.m., the gunman shot a woman in front of her children at an apartment complex parking lot, prosecutor Jeffrey Getting said. The woman was struck multiple times but is expected to survive. Four hours later, the gunman killed a father and son at a car dealership, police said. Minutes afterward, he drove to a Cracker Barrel restaurant and opened fire in the parking lot, killing four women and wounding a 14-year-old girl. Two of the shootings were captured on video, Getting said. "These were very deliberate killings. This wasn't hurried in any way, shape or form," said Getting, who has reviewed the video with police. "They were intentional, deliberate and, I don't want to say casually done. Coldly done is what I want to say." Two hours after the final shooting, police found a suspect: Jason Brian Dalton, 45. He was arrested without incident in downtown Kalamazoo. Police also seized a weapon from his car. The gun, a semi-automatic pistol, according to Getting, seems to match shell casings at the three shooting scenes, he said. Matt Mellen said he rode in Dalton's car just before the shootings started. "We got about a mile from my house, and he got a telephone call. After that call, he started driving erratically, running stop signs," Mellen said. "He just kind of kept??looking at me like-don't you want to get to your friend's house and I'm like, 'I want to get their alive.' We were driving through medians, driving through the lawn, speeding along and when we came to a stop, I jumped out the car and ran away." WOOD-TV reported that another man told the station he had sought an Uber ride as a safer alternative to walking with a killer on the loose, only to apparently end up in Dalton's car. "I kind of jokingly said to the driver, 'You're not the shooter, are you?' He gave me some sort of a 'no' response ... shook his head," the station quoted the man, whom it identified only as Derek, as saying. "I said, 'Are you sure?' And he said, 'No, I'm not, I'm just tired.' And we proceeded to have a pretty normal conversation after that." Uber's chief security officer told CNN that Dalton passed a background check. Police also said Dalton did not have a criminal record. "For all intents and purposes, he was your average Joe," the public safety chief said. "This was random." Police say they don't think the shootings were acts of terrorism. Under federal law, "terrorism" refers to a violent or dangerous crime that appears to be intended to either (1) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (2) influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or (3) affect government conduct by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping, constitutional lawyer Page Pate wrote. "My best sense is that it was somebody who was having an issue at the time and for whatever reason they decided to do what they did," Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said. Dalton was charged with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight charges of using a firearm during the commission of a felony. The murder charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole, he said. The views expressed are not those of this site, this station or its affiliated companies.

According to police, officers responded to the establishment on Lee Road around 2:45 a.m. for a report of a woman shot. When officers arrived, the victim,23, was crying as she was carried by a security guard. She was taken to University Hospital. The security guard told police he had escorted a customer out of the club and an argument ensued in the parking lot. The victim walked outside the club and the guard said he heard shots coming from Lotus Drive before he saw the suspect running toward Holly Hill Drive. The suspect fled in a silver Volkswagon vehicle. The suspect is described as an unknown black male, about 5-foot-8, who may go by the name "Tune" or "Gene."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":54,"startIndex":45,"value":"CLEVELAND"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":282,"startIndex":274,"value":"2:45 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-19","details":{"endIndex":171,"startIndex":126,"value":"outside the King of Diamonds gentlemen's club"},"state":"OH - Ohio","time-day":{"endIndex":192,"startIndex":185,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":866,"startIndex":848,"value":" \"Tune\" or \"Gene.\""},"race":{"endIndex":803,"startIndex":798,"value":"black"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":350,"startIndex":348,"value":"23"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AAXV8W6U1V9CM
376	http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20160210/NEWS/160219970	D.A.: Fatal shooting of man by police in Chester ?justified,? suspect pointed gun at cops	D.A.: Fatal shooting of man by police in Chester ?justified,? suspect pointed gun at copsDistrict Attorney Jack Whelan said Wednesday that the officers from Chester, Upland and Chester Township police departments who fired at Shalamar Longer, 33, were justified because Longer led police on an automobile chase before pointing a loaded weapon at the officers. RICK KAUFFMAN — DIGITAL FIRST MEDIA MEDIA COURTHOUSE >> A 33-year-old Chester City man shot dead by police early Monday morning reportedly told his cousin he was “not going back to jail” before pointing a loaded handgun at officers, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said Wednesday. “That speaks volumes, that he’s not going back to jail,” Whelan told reporters gathered at the Criminal Investigation Division press room Wednesday morning. “The reasonable interpretation is that, ‘I’m going to do whatever I can not to go back to jail, including killing police officers.’” Shalamar Longer died in a hail of gunfire while sitting in the driver seat of a 2004 Chevy Trailblazer on the 1200 block of Keystone Avenue. Six officers fired into the vehicle after Longer pointed a handgun at them, according to Whelan. Longer did not fire his weapon and none of the officers were injured. Whelan estimated more than 50 and probably closer to 100 rounds were fired at the vehicle after Longer pointed the older model revolver at officers. Longer’s cousin, 24-year-old Asmar Longer, the sole passenger, was also struck in the foot or ankle area and has since been released from the hospital. No charges are pending against Asmar Longer and he provided a statement to police, Whelan said. Whelan said the investigation into the shooting is ongoing, but that the use of deadly force at this point appears justified. Whelan noted CID acts an independent police investigation arm separate from the 42 other police precincts in the county. The confrontation began at 2:13 a.m. Monday when an Upland officer passed the Chevy and noticed it had a burned-out license plate lamp, according to Whelan. The officer performed a u-turn to radio in the plate number, but had not yet initiated a traffic stop when the other vehicle accelerated away. Whelan noted Shalamar Longer had an extensive criminal record and was on parole for a 2012 robbery in Philadelphia, for which he was sentenced to three to six years. As a convicted felon, Longer could not legally possess a gun. The pursuit was not what would be deemed “high speed,” according to Whelan, and lasted about six to 10 minutes. Numerous units from various police departments joined in the chase, including Chester City, Upland and Chester Township. The driver allegedly went into Chester, got onto I-95 at Kerlin Avenue, exited the highway at Highland Avenue, and continued to Keystone Avenue, where the vehicle crashed into a parked car for unknown reasons, Whelan said. Police cars were not involved in the crash, he said. The Chevy came to rest partially on a residential lawn. Asmar Longer told investigators that his cousin did not want to stop the vehicle and pulled out a handgun, indicating he was “not going back to jail,” Whelan said. Asmar Longer dove from the passenger side of the vehicle after the crash and claims to have blacked out, Whelan said, though he does remember hearing gunfire. Whelan said the six officers fired into the Chevy after Shalamar Longer pointed the gun at them, though there were more officers on scene. Whelan said one officer saw the weapon and shouted, “Gun!” causing the other officers to draw their weapons. “As the gun was pointed at multiple officers, is what our preliminary investigation reveals, these officers opened fire on this driver … believing that they were in imminent fear of serious bodily injury or even death in this particular case,” said Whelan. Whelan added that the high number of rounds fired is not unreasonable, given that there were six officers shooting. When officers feel they are in a life-or-death situation, he said, the tendency is to empty the magazine at the offender. “When we do our analysis, we’re looking at not whether they shot once, twice, or 10 times at that particular individual,” said Whelan. “What we’re looking at is did this individual have the right to fire that weapon from the beginning, did the law enforcement officer have the right to utilize deadly force. So when he shoots and he shoots multiple times, which is not unusual, that’s not part of the analysis.” Among those firing were four Chester City officers, one Upland officer and one Chester Township officer, said Whelan. He said it would be up to the individual police departments to determine how they will handle placing those officers until the investigation is complete, but he believes the Chester City officers have been assigned to administrative duties. Whelan said investigators have spoken to family members and neighbors in the area, and that he heard a rumor that there might be another eyewitness, but that was not confirmed as of Wednesday. Anyone with additional information to contribute is urged to contact the District Attorney’s office at 610-891-4161.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1316,"startIndex":1306,"value":"100 rounds"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":4554,"startIndex":4547,"value":"Chester"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1928,"startIndex":1924,"value":"2:13"},"date":"2016-02-22","details":{"endIndex":2801,"startIndex":2786,"value":"Keystone Avenue"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":487,"startIndex":480,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":245,"startIndex":243,"value":"33"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":241,"startIndex":226,"value":"Shalamar Longer"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1421,"startIndex":1419,"value":"24"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1597,"startIndex":1585,"value":"Asmar Longer"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2VJ7MU7N1L5EF

The girl died in one of the most violent areas of Los Angeles County after a gunman got out of a car Tuesday evening and fired at least five rounds at a converted garage where the child lived with her parents. The shooting sparked a plea from the mayor of Compton for residents to renew the fight against gang attacks. Her mother, Blanche Wandick, said she misses her baby. "My innocent baby got shot for nothing," the tearful Wandick, who is pregnant, told TV reporters. "I appreciate anybody and everybody who's helping try to find who did it." Sheriff's deputies were called to a home around 7 p.m. where they found a man on the sidewalk cradling the wounded infant, sheriff's Capt. Myron Johnson said at an afternoon news conference. The deputies took the child to a hospital in Lynwood, where she died, he said. Authorities were searching for the gunman and the driver of the getaway car. They were seen speeding away from the neighborhood in a dark sedan. Sheriff's officials also pleaded for public help in finding the killer. Tipsters can remain anonymous, they said. "We're following every lead as it comes in, real time," sheriff's homicide Capt. Steven Katz. "We believe that there are people out there in the community who may have information to offer." Investigators believe the shooter wanted to hit the child's 24-year-old father, who has acknowledged being a member of a street gang, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said. "He was probably the intended target, and a stray bullet caught his daughter," Corina said, adding that the father was "somewhat cooperative" with detectives. His name was not released. Compton Mayor Aja Brown identified the child as 1-year-old Autumn Johnson and also asked for help from the public. "I stand today with Compton residents in recommitting ourselves to the fight against gang violence," the mayor said. During the past six months, Compton has had 475 violent crimes, including eight homicides, according to the Los Angeles Times. Nearly all the tidy homes in the neighborhood have bars on the windows.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":263,"oldEnd":262,"oldStart":250,"startIndex":251,"value":"Los Angeles "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":907,"startIndex":901,"value":"7 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-10","details":{"endIndex":163,"startIndex":156,"value":"Compton"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":1027,"oldEnd":1026,"oldStart":1016,"startIndex":1017,"value":"afternoon "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1983,"startIndex":1973,"value":"1-year-old"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":1998,"startIndex":1984,"value":"Autumn Johnson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1ENHFQSXOXG6I

None of the injuries were considered life-threatening, according to Mike Meyers with Rockdale County Sheriff's Office. The two suspects were taken into custody at the end of a chase Sunday morning. The incident began as a 911 call for a burglary in progress in the 800 block of Cambridge Creek Drive in Conyers. A woman said a stranger was trying to kick down her back door, but he was scared away by the alarm. Minutes later, a sheriff's deputy spotted a vehicle matching the description and attempted to pull it over. The suspects in the vehicle fled the scene and the deputy began chase. When deputies boxed in the suspect's vehicle, the driver drove the vehicle into a deputy on foot, knocking him to the ground. Other deputies on scene began firing rounds into the suspect's vehicle but the suspects kept going. The chase continued into Lithonia and ended on Chupp Way Circle where deputies reportedly performed the PIT maneuver, immobilizing the vehicle. The two suspects were arrested and both appeared to have been shot by deputies during the earlier incident. They were transported to an area hospital where they were treated for non life-threatening injuries. The deputy who was struck by the vehicle was treated on the scene and released. Two other suspects bailed out of the car during the chase and are still on the loose. Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

The two 15-year-old Independence High School sophomores were not identified by police. Their bodies were found near the cafeteria after a shooting was reported at the high school just before 8 a.m., police said. Glendale police said investigators believe one girl fatally shot the other and then killed herself. A suicide note was found at the scene, police said. "During the processing of the scene, a suicide note was located," police said in a statement. "Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appearing to also be in a relationship." Each girl suffered one gunshot wound and a firearm was found at the scene, police said. Gunshots were heard but it doesn't appear any other students witnessed the shooting, police said. The shooting led police to lock down the school of around 2,000. "Our hearts and minds are with the families who lost children today. We offer our deepest condolences," Independence Principal Rob Ambrose said in a letter to parents. Social workers will be at the high school Saturday as well as next week to help students and family members, the school district said. "Our heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of these two girls," Glendale Mayor Jerry Weiers said in a statement.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":705,"startIndex":702,"value":"two"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":63,"startIndex":55,"value":"Glendale"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":393,"startIndex":388,"value":"8 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-12","details":{"endIndex":51,"startIndex":27,"value":"Independence High School"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":144,"startIndex":137,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":207,"startIndex":205,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":207,"startIndex":205,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":207,"startIndex":205,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A38OYO6BYY7F7J

He is currently being held at the Dawson County Jail on a $100,000 bond. Lamesa police are investigating the shooting death of Dominique Adams, who died Tuesday afternoon on his way to UMC. Lamesa Police Chief Dale Alwan says they have a person of interest detained and are conducting interviews as of Tuesday night. Police got the call around 3 p.m. about the shooting at South 4th Street and Avenue H. If you have any information about this incident, police ask that you contact Crime Line at 872-TIPS. It is a call no Lamesa citizen wants to hear, that a neighborhood resident was gunned down. “Things like this really don’t happen that often in a small town,” said Lamesa city councilman Chance Britt. “When they do, it hurts us as a community. Hopefully this investigation is resolved quickly.” Lamesa Chief of Police Dale Alwan says when he arrived on scene after 3 p.m., the ambulance had left with Dominique Adams, who suffered from critical gunshot wounds. The ambulance took Adams to meet Aeorocare in O’Donnell, but Alwan said Adams died before that could happen.

Tiana Carruthers put herself between a group of kids and gunman Jason Dalton at the beginning of his Saturday night rampage in Michigan, when he killed six and wounded two others. Carruthers was hit three times in the legs and arms, according toWWMT,but is expected to survive after receiving multiple surgeries. The 25-year-old and several children, including at least one of her own, were outside at the Meadows Townhomes when Dalton, a 45-year-old Uber driver, drove up right before 6 p.m. "Have you seen Mazie?" he asked Joi Coleman, 12. As of Monday night it was unclear who Mazie is, or why Dalton asked about her before beginning the shooting. Coleman said Carruthers asked him if there was anything she could do for him before he opened fire. “He shot her once and she was still running and then he shot her again and she fell. She was asking 'Joi, help me. Joi, help me,” the young girl recounted. Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said that the mother "sensed trouble" before sending the kids inside as quickly as possible. Dalton had reportedly come to the apartment complex earlier in the day. The gunman would go on to shoot dead Richard Smith and his son Tyler, 17, as the pair was looking at cars around 10 p.m. Shortly after he killed Mary Lou Nye, 60, Mary Joe Nye, 62, Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Dorothy Brown, 74, at a nearby Cracker Barrel. Fourteen-year-old Abigail Kopf was also shot at the country restaurant and was fighting for her life as of Monday night. Dalton, who had been picking up fares during the night of his attacks, was arrested early Sunday morning and now faces charges of first degree murder. Carruthers was able to pick Dalton out of a lineup and tell investigators that he left in a silver SUV, according toMLive. Dalton, a former insurance adjuster, also reportedly confessed to the attacks and was denied bail on Monday.

Troopers said Mark Gaspard, 24, of Innis, was booked on a manslaughter charge in the shooting death of Mario Celestino, 40. Bond was set at $100,000. According to LSP, Gaspard is charged because the deputy did not ask for his assistance or to get involved in a "law enforcement situation." The shooting happened in Innis, a small community near Batchelor, which is in rural Pointe Coupee Parish. Investigators said it happened in the 8300 block of LA 418 around 4 p.m. Louisiana State Police was called in by the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff's Office to assist with the investigation because a deputy with PCPSO was on the scene but did not fire his weapon. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff's Office said Celestino allegedly kidnapped his ex-girlfriend's mother at gunpoint from her home in Avoyelles Parish. Deputies said he demanded the woman tell him where his ex-friend was. According to officials, Celestino drove to Gaspard's house with his ex-girlfriend's mother in the car with him. They added Gaspard is dating the sister of Celestino's ex-girlfriend. The also said a deputy with PCPSO was at the house waiting for Celestino. Celestino allegedly got out of the car with a weapon. Investigators stated when the deputy tried to put handcuffs on him, Celestino ran. Authorities reported Gaspard then got involved in the situation and started running behind the deputy and Celestino in what they said they believe was an attempt to try to help the deputy. They added when Celestino stopped and turned around toward the deputy, Gaspard allegedly fired once and hit Celestino in the head, killing him. The Investigators learned Celestino's ex-girlfriend got a restraining order against him January 2016. Her reason for doing so? She claimed in the order that he slapped, punched, choked, shoved, kicked, stalked, threatened bodily harm, her life, sexually abused and threatened her with a weapon. According to the restraining order, she gave specifics on her most recent abuse incident on Nov. 11, 2015, saying Celestino "held gun to my head six times and used knuckles two times threatening as a weapon. Also, turned gun on himself and tried forcing my hand to pull trigger. Three separate occasions of sexual assault and violation while restrained." The allegations go on saying things like she has had various items thrown at her from food, drinks, glass to furniture, had her leg smashed between an ottoman and sofa, shook her head holding her ears, spit in her face and hair. and if she refused him sex, she claims he kicked her out of the bed, shattered seven iPhones and two iPads and even fish-hooked the inside of her cheeks. "This guy was a horrible, horrible person, but when police officers are doing their job, you got to step back and let them do their job. You just can't have a vigilante type attitude," said Pointe Coupee District Attorney's lead prosecutor Tony Clayton. Clayton said it will be up to a grand jury to decide whether Gaspard should be indicted with manslaughter. "So here the issue is did this person act reasonably? The standard is whether a reasonable person would have been in that same situation would have done the same thing, then his conduct will be forgiven so this reasonable man test is what we must present to the grand jury," said Clayton. Authorities did not report any other injuries in connection with Monday's shooting. Louisiana State Police is investigating the shooting, while the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff's Office is investigating the kidnapping. Copyright 2016 WAFB.

Officers arrested Andres Carillo-Delara, 18, whose mother is a resident of an apartment complex at 312 Weant Blvd., on charges of first-degree burglary with a deadly weapon, a class 3 felony, and menacing, a class 5 felony. It was unclear whether Carillo-Delara also lived at the apartment complex. Carbondale police received a call at around 8:30 a.m. about a man with a gun in a unit at the apartment complex, said Carbondale Police Chief Gene Schilling. Some family members were also in the apartment, but they were able to leave unharmed, according to police. Carbondale police officers secured the area but were unable to get the man to come out. Bridges High School and Ross Montessori School, which are both near the residence, were placed on lock-in, meaning students and staff had to stay in the building, according to school officials. Roaring Fork School District Superintendent Diana Sirko was at Bridges for a meeting Tuesday morning. She said the other Carbondale schools were alerted to the situation, but were not included in the lock-in order. Officers blocked off streets around the residence and asked that people not try to enter the area. The residence is property of the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, which uses it as employee housing, said Jamie Tatsuno, RFTA communications manager. Garfield County???s All Hazard Response Team, including the Sheriff???s Office BearCat armored vehicle, arrived at the home shortly after noon, and officers began negotiating with the suspect in the afternoon over a loudspeaker. They urged him to come out of the residence or communicate in some way. At least two cracks from police firearms were heard, which Schilling said were beanbag-like rounds being shot at the suspect. The chief said Carillo-Delara received minor injuries from being hit by one of those rounds. Curious residents and neighbors gathered at roadblocks around the scene, many taking pictures with their smartphones. The tactical unit positioned the BearCat outside the house and spoke to the suspect using the loudspeaker, urging him to ???Come on out, man.??? A negotiator said over the speaker that authorities were concerned for his safety and that ???man to man,??? the officer wanted him to ???come out with your hands up.??? Carillo-Delara gave himself up to police just after 2 p.m. Only later did authorities determine that what had initially appeared to be a real firearm was actually a BB gun, Schilling said. In addition to tactical team and Carbondale Police Department, Garfield County Sheriff???s Office, Silt Police Department, Rifle Police Department, Glenwood Springs Police Department, Carbondale and Rural Fire Protection District, Glenwood Springs Fire Department, Colorado River Fire Rescue, Roaring Fork School District and Carbondale Public Works assisted with the effort, said the chief.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1877,"startIndex":1866,"value":" two cracks"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1898,"startIndex":1883,"value":"police firearms"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":154,"startIndex":144,"value":"Carbondale"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":592,"startIndex":583,"value":" 8:30 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":355,"startIndex":340,"value":"312 Weant Blvd."},"state":"CO - Colorado","time-day":{"endIndex":1187,"startIndex":1179,"value":" morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":83,"startIndex":77,"value":"18-yea"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":280,"startIndex":259,"value":"Andres Carillo-Delara"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":284,"startIndex":282,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":280,"startIndex":259,"value":"Andres Carillo-Delara"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":83,"startIndex":77,"value":"18-yea"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":280,"startIndex":259,"value":"Andres Carillo-Delara"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A14JNHAVQN9IXX

(AP) -- Prosecutors have charged a woman with fatally shooting her husband in Oconomowoc nine months ago. Fifty-two-year-old Amy Van Wagner was charged Wednesday with first-degree intentional murder and hiding a corpse, both felonies. Van Wagner's cash bond was set at $100,000. Her husband, 50-year-old Stan Van Wagner, was found fatally shot in the basement of their home in May 2015. Investigators say Stan Van Wagner had been shot three times elsewhere in the home and his body moved to the basement. WISN-TV (http://bit.ly/1p4qgdy ) reports investigators believe the victim was shot with his own handgun. Prosecutors allege Amy Van Wagner sent text messages from her dead husband's phone, posing as him. Amy Van Wagner's lawyer, John Schiro, objected to the charges, saying there is no evidence linking her to the crime. Despite a new poll that shows 62 percent of Wisconsin voters want the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat filled this year, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) told 27 News Wednesday he will continue to support Senate Republican leadership's decision to block any new justice nominated by President Barack Obama.

"A gun was pointed at one of our tactical team officers, who was in his turnout gear, at which time the suspect was shot", Sergeant Crump said. Police said the parents were in an upstairs bedroom. Investigators believe the suspect shot four members of his family. "Whether he was in the process of shooting himself or had, we don't know that at this point, and we're not going to know that until there is an autopsy", Crump said. The other was a girl between the ages of 8 and 12. As Crump related, police put on breathing masks and entered the home, only to be shot at by the attacker. Police have not yet released the victims' identities. The flames were so strong that firefighters fled from the building. - Police say a five people, including a shooting suspect and small child, have died in a family shooting in Phoenix on Tuesday morning. This image made from video provided by KNXV ABC-15 Arizona shows firefighters atop a house engulfed in flames in Phoenix on Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2016. He praised the coordination of public safety agencies from Phoenix and neighboring cities. Then, was after the fire was extinguished, two victims' bodies were discovered, Crump said. A girl was also hospitalized in critical condition. After the gunman was shot, the officers were told to leave because fire had reignited in the attic, sending flames through a ceiling, Crump said. A Fire Department spokeswoman says the shooter set the house on fire. Crews were working a first-alarm fire at the home, as well. They pulled out two victims, but they had to make a hasty retreat as bullets flew their way. Police responded to a 911 call from one of the victims saying they had been shot. Media gathered outside reported hearing gunshots coming from the house as well. The gunman reportedly fired at police officers and firefighters as they rushed to the scene. The mayor called the murder of the family an "unbelievable tragedy" and added that "unspeakable violence" had happened inside the Phoenix home. Once again, first responders attempted to put out the fire. Four gunshot victims were found at the scene. Dozens of fire units are at the scene, which is near North 43rd Avenue and West Cactus Road.

The shooting was reported at 4:48 a.m. Rick Ryan, a police captain, said the shooting occurred in a residence on the 1500 block of Empire Avenue, and the suspect and the victim know each other. The victim is a 37-year-old man who lives in Park City while the suspect is a 27-year-old man from Midvale, the Police Department said. Ryan said dispatchers received a report of a gunshot victim from someone who went to the 7-Eleven store close to the site of the shooting. The police responded to the convenience store and learned from the person where the victim was located. The victim was taken to a hospital in the Salt Lake Valley. The Police Department said he was in critical condition when he left in the ambulance. Ryan said the police arrested the suspect in the vicinity of the shooting and the suspect was brought to the Summit County Jail. Bail is $100,000, according to the police. Formal charges had not been filed at 3rd District Court by midmorning on Tuesday. Ryan said one shot was fired, adding there was more than one witness in the residence at the time. The investigation is continuing. The victim works at No Name Saloon & Grill and Boneyard Saloon & Wine Dive, the owner of the two places, Jesse Shetler, said. Shetler said the victim is Jose Fernandez, an employee for nearly nine years. He is a full-time bartender and a part-time manager, according to Shetler. "He is an exemplary member of the staff," Shetler said, calling Fernandez "such a good friend to all of us." Shetler said there has been an "outpouring of love" since the shooting.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1218,"oldEnd":1217,"oldStart":1213,"startIndex":1214,"value":"one "},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":95,"startIndex":86,"value":"Park City"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":268,"startIndex":259,"value":"4:48 a.m."},"date":"2016-03-21","details":{"endIndex":374,"startIndex":347,"value":"1500 block of Empire Avenue"},"state":"UT - Utah","time-day":{"endIndex":119,"startIndex":112,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":504,"startIndex":502,"value":"27"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":442,"startIndex":440,"value":"37"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1503,"startIndex":1489,"value":"Jose Fernandez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AVKU3G6QJAYFE

Here's what we know about the attacks. Authorities said a gunman shot eight people in three different parts of the county on Feb. 20. Around 5:42 p.m., the gunman shot a woman in front of her children at an apartment complex parking lot, prosecutor Jeffrey Getting said. The woman was struck multiple times but is expected to survive. Four hours later, the gunman killed a father and son at a car dealership, police said. Minutes afterward, he drove to a Cracker Barrel restaurant and opened fire in the parking lot, killing four women and wounding a 14-year-old girl. Two of the shootings were captured on video, Getting said. "These were very deliberate killings. This wasn't hurried in any way, shape or form," said Getting, who has reviewed the video with police. "They were intentional, deliberate and, I don't want to say casually done. Coldly done is what I want to say." Two hours after the final shooting, police found a suspect: Jason Brian Dalton, 45. He was arrested without incident in downtown Kalamazoo. Police also seized a weapon from his car. The gun, a semi-automatic pistol, according to Getting, seems to match shell casings at the three shooting scenes, he said. Matt Mellen said he rode in Dalton's car just before the shootings started. "We got about a mile from my house, and he got a telephone call. After that call, he started driving erratically, running stop signs," Mellen said. "He just kind of kept??looking at me like-don't you want to get to your friend's house and I'm like, 'I want to get their alive.' We were driving through medians, driving through the lawn, speeding along and when we came to a stop, I jumped out the car and ran away." WOOD-TV reported that another man told the station he had sought an Uber ride as a safer alternative to walking with a killer on the loose, only to apparently end up in Dalton's car. "I kind of jokingly said to the driver, 'You're not the shooter, are you?' He gave me some sort of a 'no' response ... shook his head," the station quoted the man, whom it identified only as Derek, as saying. "I said, 'Are you sure?' And he said, 'No, I'm not, I'm just tired.' And we proceeded to have a pretty normal conversation after that." Uber's chief security officer told CNN that Dalton passed a background check. Police also said Dalton did not have a criminal record. "For all intents and purposes, he was your average Joe," the public safety chief said. "This was random." Police say they don't think the shootings were acts of terrorism. Under federal law, "terrorism" refers to a violent or dangerous crime that appears to be intended to either (1) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (2) influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or (3) affect government conduct by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping, constitutional lawyer Page Pate wrote. "My best sense is that it was somebody who was having an issue at the time and for whatever reason they decided to do what they did," Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said. Dalton was charged with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight charges of using a firearm during the commission of a felony. The murder charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole, he said. The views expressed are not those of this company or its affiliated companies.

On Sunday morning, investigators uncovered additional bullet rounds and evidence over a six-mile scene. Kenton police officer Skylar Newfer remains hospitalized after being shot by 47-year-old Stephen Davis. The situation began Saturday around 5 p.m. when Kenton police officers responded to a dispute call, according to Sheriff Everhart. Davis was reported to have been sitting with a gun in a vehicle in front of a Grove Street residence Saturday evening. When officers approached the vehicle, Davis left the scene after briefly exiting and firing a single shot at the officers. A chase ensued and Sheriff Everhart says his deputies assisted. A couple miles later the chase paused at the intersection of County Road 106 and State Route 309. "The suspect apparently stopped at that point, exited his vehicle and engaged the officers,” Everhart said. That’s when Everhart says Newfer was wounded, struck twice in the back. Davis got back in his car and sped off, according to Everhart. He says one deputy pulled the wounded Newfer into his cruiser and rushed him to Hardin Memorial Hospital, while the other deputy chased Davis. Davis continued for another five miles along country roads. He stopped on multiple occasions and turned back to the cruiser firing his weapon, according to Everhart. He says the pursuing officer did return fire. "We have had a history with Mr. Davis," Everhart said. "There have been times over the last 20 years where there have been weapons involved, nothing ever to this point, obviously, but he's been on our radar for a number of years." Sheriff Everhart says it’s unclear how many bullets were fired, but says Davis was shooting a long rifle. Two or three miles later, Everhart says Davis crashed on County Road 106, where he died. “At this point, I do not know if [Davis] was struck by my officer, Kenton officers, [or] himself, but it does appear that he was shot,” he said. Everhart says he was with Officer Newfer at the hospital and helped take off his equipment before Newfer was taken by helicopter to Grant Medical Center in Columbus. According to Newfer's mother, Officer Newfer is in "good condition." Musser says his officer is in "good spirits" and thanks the Columbus Police Department for its support, saying Columbus police have offered its help, if needed. Davis is a former dog warden in Hardin County. He served jail time after pleading guilty in a 2009 case to complicity to tampering with records, falsification and disorderly conduct. Police Chief Musser said the coroner will perform toxicology tests to determine whether or not alcohol played a role.

It happened just after 9:30 Sunday night. Officers arrived to find an armed woman believed to be in her late 30s or early 40s near a canal. She was firing her weapon. Police tried to "talk her down," but instead of dropping her handgun, she reportedly pointed it at an officer," according to Sgt. Jonathan Howard of the Phoenix Police Department. Fearing for his or her safety, that officer shot the suspect. The unidentified woman was in serious condition when she was taken to the hospital. She later died, according to Howard. No officers were injured. It's not clear what the woman was doing by the canal or why she was shooting. The officer who shot her will be placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure any time an officer fires his or her service weapon. This is the ninth officer-involved shooting in Arizona this year. Two happened in Mesa and two happened in Phoenix. The remaining incidents were outside the Phoenix metro area. The neighborhood of northwest of 23rd Avenue and Indian School Road was the site of another shooting Saturday. A man was wounded, but his injuries were not life threatening. Howard said the man would not provide officers with any information about what happened or details about the shooter. It is not clear if the two incidents are related by anything other than location.

The meeting was part of a series Isaac, Mayor John Cranley and City Manager Harry Black have been holding around Cincinnati. They're a place for city leaders to listen to neighbors' concerns and ideas as the Cincinnati Police Department works to curb gun violence in 2016. IN DEPTH: Here's the city's plan to cut crime Some speakers applauded the CPD's efforts on community relations and crime reduction; many also said they look forward to a new police substation opening in the College Hill neighborhood. Kamiah Twitty, a student at Western Hills High School, brought up concerns about mental health and teen suicide. "At West High, I honestly only know of one counselor in the entire high school," she said. "That shouldn't be." "I absolutely believe that mental health is one of the next civil rights movements that we need to fund and expand funding for and treatment for as we move forward," Cranley said. But a large portion of Monday night's meeting, held at the College Hill Community Center, focused on last week's police shooting death of Paul Gaston. Isaac said three officers fired nine rounds into Gaston after he ignored commands to lie flat on the ground and instead raised up, appearing to retrieve a firearm from his waistband. Isaac said the gun was an airsoft pistol, which he called "a very realistic-looking firearm." When people at Monday night's meeting raised concerns, Isaac defended the officers' actions as "consistent with their training." And, he said, he's highly aware of the need for positive relations between police officers and the community they serve. "The reason that I am a police officer today is because of the experiences that I had with officers as a young man," Isaac said. "So when we have these incidents, I take them to heart. They mean something to me." On Sunday, the hacker group “Anonymous” posted a YouTube video showing a masked man at a podium with a digitized voice who threatened to release the personal information of Cincinnati police officers involved in Gaston's shooting. The group compared his death with an incident in Mount Healthy from a day earlier where a white man, Christopher Laugle, was arrested after police said he pointed a toy gun at officers. The voice in the video compared Gaston's case to other black men carrying toy weapons who have been shot by police in Ohio, including John Crawford and Tamir Rice. The voice suggests there is a double standard based on race. Officers said Laugle's weapon had bright orange markings on the barrel, making it an obvious fake, unlike Gaston's airsoft gun. The president of Cincinnati's Fraternal Order of Police called Anonymous a "fringe group" that was looking to rile up officers with its threat. Last month, Cincinnati police officers shot and killed Robert Tenbrink, a white man, after he pointed an object at them; it was later determined to be a BB gun.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-22","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"OH - Ohio","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3422FS8PT4NQC

719	http://www.kvue.com/news/local/murder-suspect-shares-his-side-of-story/45884057	Murder suspect shares his side of story	Murder suspect shares his side of storyHAYS COUNTY -- For the first time, Esaia Morris, the man charged in the shooting death of former Texas State Color Guard member Francisco Sierra, is speaking out. In an exclusive jailhouse interview, Morris shared his version of what happened in the early morning hours of Feb. 5 with KVUE. "It was self-defense," claimed Morris, who spoke with KVUE in an interview room at the Hays County Jail where he is currently being held. Sierra, 20, moved into Morris' apartment on Feb. 1, which they shared with two other roommates- both Texas State students. It was the first time Sierra met any of the roommates, but Morris said there were no issues. "I can say everybody liked him in there. Everybody was pretty cool with Francisco," Morris said, before adding that Sierra was even teaching him how to drive. The night of Feb. 4, Sierra and another roommate were celebrating their birthday. Morris claims that both he and Sierra were drunk when they began discussing suicide. Morris said that he told Sierra to suffocate him with a pillow. But once Sierra began doing so, Morris says he began to fight back, and claimed he pleaded with Sierra to stop. "And at that point I got frantic and I started flailing some more and I said 'Stop,'" Morris said. At that point, Morris claimed that Sierra made a sexual advance towards him. That's when he said he went for his gun that was in his waistband. "I took that gun and put it to the pillow. I didn't mean for what happened to happen, but it did. And Francisco Sierra lost his life," Morris said. He said he got the gun from a friend to serve as protection since he didn't know his roommates before moving into his apartment. "I never said I killed him in cold-blood. I never said I killed him for no reason," Morris said. He said he didn't remember the exact timing of the altercation, but said it happened fast. "It was really quick. From the conversation to the whole event, it was really quick. Everything happened so fast," said Morris. After the altercation, Morris said he went to his job at Epic Piping in San Marcos, where he disposed of the gun in a pond in front of the factory. While at work, he confided to a co-worker about what happened. Morris said the coworker told police and Morris came forward to report Sierra's death. During police questioning, he admitted to the deadly shooting. "I gave (police) the weapon. I gave them the evidence. I pretty much gave them everything. Gave them pretty much signed, printed, sealed," Morris said. Morris said he has accepted the events of the night, but wants his day in court. "Since I came (to jail), I feel remorseful, and I feel guilt. But I don't feel it for the fact that I was defending myself. I feel it more so for the fact of loss of life. That his family will miss him. That they're without a son now," Morris said. "But in the same sense, my momma will miss me. My little brother will miss me. My girlfriend will miss me, if it had been in reverse." Morris said he did not want to discuss personal issues that lead to his suicidal thoughts, but stressed he was happy with his job and had no issue with relationships. He does have a message for Sierra's family. "I'm sorry for what happened. I never meant for it to go that far. And if I could switch places I would. But unfortunately I can't. And what's done is done. I have nightmares, I think about it. There's nothing I can do. I can't rewind. Can't take what's happened back," Morris said. Morris said he has a court-appointed attorney, but his family is trying to retain outside counsel. He has not received any visitors in jail and is being held on a $1 million bond. Sierra's family disputes Morris' version, saying Francisco was not suicidal. At the time of his death, Sierra was a manager at TUMI at the San Marcos Outlets. He was a Texas State student as recently as the first semester of this school year. Francisco was laid to rest near his home in Mesquite this past weekend. Two other roommates were present at the time of the shooting, but police say they had no involvement in the case.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":428,"startIndex":417,"value":"Hays County"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":302,"startIndex":289,"value":"early morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":86,"startIndex":74,"value":"Esaia Morris"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":478,"startIndex":476,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":183,"startIndex":167,"value":"Francisco Sierra"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A23KO2TP7I4KK2

Boston Police officers arrived at the 107 Devon St. around 10:25 a.m., police said. They were called for a double shooting occurring inside the red-sided three-decker, and found two men around the corner near the intersection of Stanwood and Laredo streets. One man appeared to be shot in the leg, police said, and was leaning against the other man, later identified as 29-year-old Peter Fanfan of Boston. Fanfan raised the revolver in his hand, pointing it at the approaching officers. Police Commissioner William Evans said Friday that police told Fanfan to drop his gun, repeating the command twice more and telling him to show his hands. Instead, a gun battle erupted and Fanfan was shot to death. "Nobody likes to take a life, but if you're going to point a gun at an officer the way he did, obviously we're going to neutralize the threat," Evans said. No officers were hit, Evans said. Police recovered a gun at the scene and found a second victim inside the Devon Street apartment suffering from gunshot wounds. Community leaders shown video of the incident at police headquarters Saturday told the Boston Globe it appeared clear that Fanfan opened fire first. The Office of Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley is conducting an investigation into the shooting. Assistant District Attorney John Verner is leading the investigation, according to a statement from Conley's office. Fanfan has a lengthy criminal record, including 57 arraignments on his record and two stretches in prison for gun convictions.

Students walk to their parents after being released from lockdown, Friday, Feb. 12, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz., after two students were shot and killed at Independence High School in the Phoenix suburb. The danger at the campus was ... GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) - A shooting at a suburban Phoenix high school that killed two 15-year-old girls and caused panic among parents was a murder-suicide, police said. Police announced that a suicide note was found at the scene of the shooting Friday morning near the cafeteria area of Independence High School in Glendale. They said the girls each were shot once, were declared dead at the scene and a weapon was found near the bodies. "Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appeared to also be in a relationship," Glendale police spokeswoman Tracey Breeden said in a statement Friday afternoon. It is believed nobody witnessed the shooting, Breeden said. Both teens have been identified, but Breeden said "their names will not be confirmed or released at this time by the police department due to their juvenile status." Hours before the lockdown of the school was lifted, hundreds of worried parents crowded the parking lots of nearby discount and convenience stores. One woman gnawed on her fingernails as she spoke on a cellphone, while another had tears streaming down her face. Other parents chain-smoked as they waited for news. Cheryl Rice said she went to a store after a friend called about the shooting and asked about Rice's 15-year-old daughter. But the girl called to say she was safe as Rice arrived at the store. She said it was horrible waiting for word about her child. "You don't know if it's your daughter or not. You don't know who's being bullied. You don't know who is being picked on. You don't know anything. It could be anybody," Rice said. Lanie Walter, who is a senior at the school, heard ambulances on her way to campus but didn't think much of it until her first class was locked down. When she called her parents to tell them she was safe, "my mom was actually really relieved because she was watching it on the news," she said. Parents were bused to the school to be reunited with their children. Some cut through a nearby field as they rushed toward their kids in emotional reunions. Other students who got permission from their parents left campus on their own. The Glendale Union High School District alerted parents to the shooting through emails and automatic phone calls and released information on social media, Superintendent Brian Capistran said. Students typically are not allowed to use their cellphones during lockdowns, but as calls from parents flooded the district, officials asked teachers to have students call family, Capistran said. Social workers and counselors will be available to students and staff when school resumes Tuesday, the superintendent said. Minnie Kramer, mother of a 15-year-old student, said she rushed out of work when she got a text from her son right after the shooting, telling her that he was OK. As she waited to be reunited with her son, Kramer said she worried about whether any of his friends were harmed. "I know that my son is OK, but, emotionally, you don't know what it does, especially at 15, especially if it's someone he knew," Kramer said.

The gunfire occurred about 3:10 a.m. Sunday on Manchester Boulevard at Inglewood Avenue, said Inglewood police Lt. Scott Collins. When they approached the auto, they noticed the woman in the auto had a gun and ordered her and a male occupant out of the vehicle, said Scott Collins, a spokesman for the Inglewood Police Department. "An officer involved shooting then occurred", according to the statement. Witnesses describe heavy gunshots after a man and a woman were killed in an officer-involved shooting in Inglewood. A gun was recovered at the scene of the shooting, police said. No names or other details have been released. "The family is really still not sure of what happened", she said. The man and woman were both struck by gunfire. No officers were injured. Their identities were being withheld until family members were notified. Friends said she had moved to Las Vegas past year after separating from her husband, but had returned to Inglewood in the last month to visit, and was staying with her sister. "It was back to back", said Michiko Perez, a witness who lives nearby. "I feel like they are not telling us the whole story". This past weekend, Kisha Michael had asked Sherry Cole to care for her children so she could have a weekend off, Cole said. The day before she was killed, she attended a baby shower and a friend's birthday party. "She was a good mother", her sister said. After the news conference, some relatives went to the Inglewood Police Department headquarters demanding to speak with the chief of police.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":128,"startIndex":119,"value":"Inglewood"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":215,"startIndex":206,"value":"3:10 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-23","details":{"endIndex":266,"startIndex":223,"value":"on Manchester Boulevard at Inglewood Avenue"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":147,"oldEnd":146,"oldStart":140,"startIndex":141,"value":"early "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9

Police are still investigating a shooting that happened this weekend at the library. Bill Cochran, Billings Public Library's director, says shots were fired just before 2 a.m. Saturday, along the 6th avenue side. One of the entrance doors and some of the windows were shot out, he said. Police are still investigating the four bullets that have been recovered and looking at security footage. Police have spotted a white car on the footage on 6th Avenue that match up with the time the shooting took place, Cochran said. Due to how small the bullets and the fragments from the glass were, he says that it wasn't enough to set off the alarms. Who ever did this, was not targeting someone, or the library, because the shooter did it at night during the time the library was closed, he added. They have started the cleanup process, he says, but there's still glass along the window panes.With all the shards of glass they had to hire a disaster restoration company, Cochran said. Cochran says he is just thankful no one was hurt. He adds, maintenance workers sometimes work late, and there was a maintenance man there Saturday night but the worker had gone home early that night. "I don't think that there's any reason for people to fear for their safety here it was probably just random," Cochran said. Betsy Lane is a mother, and says she can't believe someone would shoot at a family facility. "Yeah, it's a big safety concern just because you know I want him to be safe and usually it doesn't happen around here," Lane said. Cochran says there's still no estimate on how much the damage will cost. POST FALLS, Idaho - Just after 3am fire crews responded to a fire at a trailer in the Arundel Mobile Home Park in Post Falls.

868	http://www.kspr.com/news/nationworld/6-dead-in-kalamazoo-county-shooting-spree/21051646_38111002	7 dead in Kalamazoo County shooting spree	7 dead in Kalamazoo County shooting spree(CNN) - At least seven people were killed during a shooting spree Kalamazoo County, Michigan, authorities said. In all, eight people were shot in three locations Saturday, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas told CNN. All three shooting incidents appear to be related, authorities said. "What it looks like is we have someone just driving around, finding people and shooting them dead in their tracks," Matyas told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV. "This is your worst nightmare, when you have somebody just driving around randomly killing people." Police have a "strong suspect" in custody, Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley told CNN affiliate WWMT. The suspect was taken into custody without incident in downtown Kalamazoo, Hadley said. "The threat to the public is over," Matyas told WOOD. "We know this is our suspect. He is in custody." Authorities recovered a weapon from the suspect's car, he said. The first shooting took place around 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), when a woman was shot four times in an apartment complex parking lot, Matyas said. She was with her three children. The woman is in serious condition. Shortly after 10 p.m. local time, two people were shot and killed at a car dealership, Matyas said. "At this point we believe [they] were just here looking at a vehicle," Hadley said.

(KTTC) - Two people have been arrested after a drug deal at a fast food restaurant led to a shooting and police pursuit in northwest Rochester early Monday morning. Rochester Police Capt. John Sherwin said three teenagers were meeting Jamile James, 21, and Keith West, 22, for a drug deal in a Taco Bell parking lot on Marketplace Drive NW at about 2:30 a.m. Monday. One of the teens, an 18-year-old man, got into the back seat of the Saturn that James and West were in. West, who was in the passenger seat, allegedly held the teenager at gunpoint, who then ran from the Saturn, back to the car where the two other teenagers were waiting. Capt. Sherwin said the three teens followed the Saturn in their own car, and called 911, saying the occupants of the Saturn were shooting at them near the intersection of 37th Street NW and 18th Avenue NW. They lost the Saturn near HyVee Barlow, but a Minnesota State Trooper found the car minutes later at 2nd Avenue and 26th Street NW. James stayed in the vehicle, but West ran away. An officer eventually found West near Zumbro Drive and West River Parkway at 3:10 a.m. A K9 officer was also able to track down a gun behind a house on the 2600 block of Westview Lane NW. Capt. Sherwin said West and James were both arrested, and face drive by shooting and 2nd degree assault charges. No one was injured in the incident.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":134,"startIndex":125,"value":"ROCHESTER"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":499,"startIndex":490,"value":" 2:30 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-22","details":{"endIndex":985,"startIndex":936,"value":"intersection of 37th Street NW and 18th Avenue NW"},"state":"MN - Minnesota","time-day":{"endIndex":305,"startIndex":298,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":413,"startIndex":411,"value":"22"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":409,"startIndex":399,"value":"Keith West"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[]}	A1265GFOC0BIDW

UPDATE: Police at 12:40 a.m. take a suspect into custody on the north side of Kalamazoo. UPDATE: Police at 12:30 a.m. confirmed they responded to multiple reports of shots fired at OP and 6th Avenue in Texas Township. No victims were found, police said. KALAMAZOO, MI — Seven people were dead Saturday night after multiple shootings around Kalamazoo County, and authorities say the person responsible seemed to be shooting "at random." The suspect is described as a white male in his 50s, driving a dark blue Chevy HHR. Five people were shot in vehicles outside the Cracker Barrel on 9th Street in Oshtemo Township. Police say that shooting is tied to another at a Seelye car dealership in Kalamazoo, and another shooting at the Meadows Townhomes complex in Richland Township. "It appears we have someone driving around and doing nothing but shooting to death innocent people at random," Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Pali Matyas said from the scene at Cracker Barrel. Matyas said the first shooting occurred at the townhomes complex, 5066 Meadows Blvd. around 6 p.m. There, a woman was shot in the parking lot. Matyas said she is in serious condition. A second shooting occurred at Seelye Ford, 4102 Stadium Drive, shortly before 10:30 p.m., where two people were shot and killed in the parking lot. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley told WWMT that the two killed at the dealership were both male, and are believed to be a father and son who were looking at a vehicle. Around 10:30 p.m., five people were shot in vehicles in the parking lot of Cracker Barrel, 5581 Cracker Barrel Blvd., off of 9th Street in Oshtemo Township. Four died at the scene, and a fifth died later at Bronson Hospital. Matyas said he didn't have any more specifics on the victims' genders and ages.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":470,"startIndex":462,"value":"multiple"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":411,"startIndex":402,"value":"KALAMAZOO"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1215,"startIndex":1209,"value":"6 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-20","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":635,"startIndex":632,"value":"50s"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":619,"startIndex":614,"value":"white"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1T83SZBP2DN65

961	http://www.ktvz.com/news/clatsop-county-da-offers-details-in-killing-of-seaside-officer/38023132	Clatsop DA: Bullet that killed Seaside officer went under vest | News - Home	Clatsop DA: Bullet that killed Seaside officer went under vest | News - HomeASTORIA, Ore. - Officials say a Seaside police officer was justified in killing a man who had shot his patrol partner. Clatsop County District Attorney Joshua Marquis said Tuesday that Sgt. Jason Goodding was shot underneath his ballistic vest Feb. 5 by Phillip Ferry as Goodding tried to arrest him on a felony warrant. Marquis says after Goodding was shot, Officer David Davidson fired at Ferry, hitting him in the hand, arm and buttocks. The Oregonian reports (http://goo.gl/scFlCV ) Ferry had methamphetamine, alcohol and marijuana in his system at the time. Officials say Ferry refused to take his hands out of his pockets and told officers, "You ain't going to like it," before the shooting. Marquis said Ferry was "given every opportunity" to safely surrender and instead "not only refused, but made statements that we now realize likely meant he intended to do much worse." Here's the full text of a statement given at a news conference Tuesday by Clatsop County District Attorney Josh Marquis, providing more details on the fatal Feb. 5 shooting of Seaside Police Sgt. Jason Godding: At about 9:20 p.m. on Friday night February 5 in downtown Seaside, a wanted 17-time felon named Phillip Ferry was spotted by two uniformed Seaside Police officers. Both officers were familiar with Mr. Ferry and a check revealed an active felony warrant. As officers tried to detain and arrest him, Ferry shot 39-year-old Seaside Police Sergeant Jason Goodding with a single shot from a semi-automatic pistol resulting in Sgt. Goodding's almost immediate death. The other officer, whom we today identify as Seaside Officer David Davidson, who has been on the Seaside force since late 2012, had at first attempted to use a Taser on Mr. Ferry. After Ferry shot Sgt. Goodding, Officer Davidson fired several rounds from his service weapon striking Mr. Ferry three times. Both Sgt. Goodding and Mr. Ferry were transferred to area hospitals, where both were declared dead. Under protocols established by Oregon Senate Bill 111 each county has a specific set of rules by which police shootings are investigated. In Clatsop County those protocols call for the District Attorney to name another agency, which in this case was the Oregon State Police, to head the investigation, with participation from other officers of the County's Major Crime Team -- drawn from the other agencies. The agency involved in the shooting contributes a single liaison officer, but does not participate in the SB 111 review. The reason for this is so that there is as much of detached investigation as is possible. These protocols do not in any way reflect on the ability of the Seaside or any other police department, but are designed to increase public confidence in the ultimate determination regarding the use of police deadly force. Starting on a 24-hour a day basis the weekend Sgt. Goodding was killed, investigators of the Oregon State Police, many from outside this area, have worked gathering evidence, attending the autopsies, viewing bodycams worn by the officers, and looking into other evidence relevant to the shooting. OSP investigators also interviewed a fourth person who was present and is not likely to be charged. The purpose of the investigation deals primarily with the shooting of Mr. Ferry. The murder of Jason Goodding was not the primary focus, not because it doesn't profoundly affect us, but because the legal issue is whether the surviving officer was justified in using deadly force. In Clatsop County, where I have held office since 1994, we do not submit shootings to Grand Juries unless the investigations reveal possible criminal behavior by someone involved in the shooting. Mr. Ferry is dead so he can't be prosecuted. Today I am here with other members of the Major Crime Team to announce that review of the evidence shows that Officer Davidson was legally and morally justified in using deadly force against Mr. Ferry. There will be no Grand Jury inquiry. Although aspects of the investigation continue and it may well be a couple weeks before all the reports are in, my opinion, that of my office and the OSP investigators is that there need be no further delay in putting to rest any issue of inappropriate use of force. I have personally reviewed the body cams of Sgt. Goodding and Officer Davidson, the lengthy interview of Officer Davidson and other evidence, and they all confirm a set of facts I will briefly set out. While working swing/split shifts on Feb. 5, both Sgt. Goodding and Off. Davidson came across Phillip Ferry, whom they knew. Because of Mr. Ferry's very extensive criminal history (17 felony and 21 misdemeanor convictions since 1983) Sgt. Gooding verified there was a warrant out. He called out, repeatedly to Mr. Ferry by name, identifying himself as a police officer and telling him to take his hands out of his pockets. When Ferry refused and, as it was later determined, kept saying "You ain't going to like it," Sgt. Gooding told him he was under arrest. Off. Davidson deployed his Taser, announcing it and firing it towards Mr. Ferry. As Mr. Ferry seemed to drop to the ground Sgt. Gooding moved in, at which point a single gunshot was fired by Ferry. Sgt. Goodding was wearing a ballistic vest but the bullet came in under the vest. A later autopsy conducted by Oregon State Medical Examiner Karen Gunson determined Sgt. Goodding's injuries were essentially immediate and fatal. Medical intervention could not have saved him. The shots that struck Mr. Ferry appeared less serious at the scene and Mr. Ferry continued to yell at officers. He was struck in the hand, arm, and buttocks. He was transferred by ambulance to Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria where emergency doctors worked on him for about half an hour before pronouncing him dead. Every piece of evidence, every witness, leads us to the same conclusion -- that Phillip Ferry, with a long history of resisting arrests and assault on police officers, was given every opportunity to surrender peaceably to uniformed officers. He not only refused but made statements that now seem to indicate that he intended to do worse. The officers repeatedly announced themselves, used less lethal force, and at the time Off. Davidson fired, his partner had been gravely wounded and he had a right to be concerned Mr. Ferry might continue to fire. Officer Davidson's status with Seaside is for that department to decide, but my office has determined he committed no criminal acts and indeed acted in the best traditions of law enforcement. Eventually, the full investigation and reports will be provided to the City of Seaside and much of that will become public record. Similarly, once the OSP investigation is over the 911 calls and some of the bodycam footage may become subject to public disclosure, but not this week. A related investigation, aided by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, is ongoing into where Ferry, a many-time convicted felon ineligible under existing state and federal laws from possessing a gun, got the firearm with which he killed Sgt. Goodding. Fortunately, shootings involving police officers are very unusual in Clatsop County. Sgt. Goodding is the second officer to be shot and killed in the last 50 years, the last being OSP Sgt. James Shepherd in 1980. In my 22 years as DA there have only been two deaths by gunfire in which police officers were involved, one a tragic training mistake at Camp Rilea and the other what we determined to be the justified shooting by an Astoria police officer of a man who attacked officers with a metal baseball bat. I cannot help but note that Sgt. Goodding was well known to all of us in the law enforcement community. His death has hit all of us where we live. Despite that pain, it was critical that a full and fair investigation of the shooting of Mr. Ferry take place. As to the fundamental issue of justification, I am satisfied that has been met. We will not soon forget the kind heart, compassion, and dedication of Jason Goodding.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":115,"startIndex":108,"value":"Seaside"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1187,"startIndex":1178,"value":"9:20 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"OR - Oregon","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":343,"startIndex":330,"value":"Phillip Ferry"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":1489,"startIndex":1478,"value":"39-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1528,"startIndex":1514,"value":"Jason Goodding"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":343,"startIndex":330,"value":"Phillip Ferry"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1489,"startIndex":1478,"value":"39-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1528,"startIndex":1514,"value":"Jason Goodding"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1N2EKNG64S9I6

When a politician tells you he wants to forbid you from owning a firearm or force you to get a license, he is telling you he doesn’t trust you. That’s an insult. ... Gun control is not about guns or crime. It is about an elite that fears and despises the common people." The rifle itself has no moral stature, since it has no will of its own. Naturally, it may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles -- Jeff Cooper (1920-2006) Note for non-American readers: Crime reports from America which describe an offender just as a "teen" or "teenager" almost invariably mean a BLACK teenager. We are advised to NOT judge ALL Muslims by the actions of a few lunatics, but we are encouraged to judge ALL gun owners by the actions of a few lunatics. Two lines below of a famous hymn that would be incomprehensible to Leftists today ("honor"? "right"? "freedom?" Freedom to agree with them is the only freedom they believe in) First to fight for right and freedom, And to keep our honor clean It is of course the hymn of the USMC -- still today the relentless warriors that they always were. The intellectual Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) said: "The object in life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane." How much do you know about Trayvon Martin? Did you recognize him in the picture above? If not you may need to know more about him.

Corporal Derrick Couch was shot in the head February 13 after responding to a robbery at a convenience store. Johnny Robinson Jr.'s father turned his son in to police after the shooting. Clarksdale Police Department charged Robinson Jr. with attempted murder and aggravated robbery. His bond is set at $700,000. Tuesday, CPD held a press conference to release the latest details in the case. CPD Chief William Read identified Leandrew "Lil Teddy" Booker, 20, as a person of interest in the investigation. CPD said Booker helped Robinson Jr. rob Corner Grocery, but did not have anything to do with the shooting of Corporal Couch. Ten minutes after the press conference, Booker was in custody. During the news conference to announce Booker's identity, officers received a tip on Booker's location. U.S. Marshals followed up on the tip and arrested Booker in the 100 block of Adams Street in Clarksdale. "The media can be your friend or your foe, and obviously this time you helped," Read said. Booker also had an outstanding warrant with the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Neither man's court date has been set. Booker's family said they were sorry about what happened and extended their sympathies to Couch's family. CPD Assistant Chief Robbie Linley said Corporal Couch is improving at the hospital. Couch was shot in the left eye. Doctors performed two surgeries to remove his eye. During the first surgery, Couch had a small stroke. The good news is Couch is now out of surgery and he is responding to commands. "He still has a long way to go, so we want to keep him in your prayers," Linley said. Couch’s father Alonzo Hardiman said his son can now open his eye and attempted to give a thumbs up from his hospital bed. "We are praying and being supportive,” Hardiman said. “Doing everything we can do.” Hardiman said he hopes the shooting proves a point that all lives matter. "Police lives matter because they are serving and protecting us," Hardiman said. Despite the horrific nature of the crime, Hardiman said he refuses to judge the men responsible. “I am not a judge," he said. "I don't want to judge them because it will mean that I will be judged." The police department also set up a benefit fund in Couch's honor. Those who wish to make a donation can do so at Regions Bank or the Clarksdale mayor's office. "All of our thoughts and prayers are with Corporal Couch and his family," Linley said. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5 and AP.

Published Wednesday, February 24th, 2016 Pasco Police are asking for help from anyone who was near Road 60 between Argent and W. Court street last night. At about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday night shots were heard around Road 60. Pasco Police said the shooting involved two cars near the Argent street intersection. The victim was shot through this car two times in the leg and tried to drive away from the scene, causing a three car accident a few blocks North. The victim's car was flipped over at Saratoga Ln. and police were able to get him out and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. "We believe this was something to do with a narcotics transaction and there was some sort of dispute," said Sgt. Rodrigo Pruneda. Police say the shooter fled south on Road 60 in a purple Hyundai Alantra 2014 or 2015 and are asking people that live in the area to check their surveillance cameras. Sgt. Pruneda said the community is not in danger and the shooting had nothing to do with the neighborhood. Police believe it was not a random act and the suspect and victim knew each other. Sgt. Pruneda added that the victim is being "less than cooperative" as detectives work on leads.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":263,"startIndex":254,"value":"6:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-24","details":{"endIndex":309,"startIndex":294,"value":" around Road 60"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":277,"startIndex":272,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1T83SZBP2DN65

Capt. Chris Costantino said police were called to the 416 3rd Street around 1:51 a.m. after residents reported shots had been fired. Costantino said Jeremy Brown, 31, was shot once in the left leg and once in the chest. Costantino said he was flown to Metro Health in Cleveland. “From my understanding he is in stable condition at this time,” Costantino said. Costantino said police were told two black male suspects one of which has dreadlocks had approached Brown although limited information as to a motive was provided to police. As officers were getting ready to leave the location they saw a car traveling south on Chestnut Street heading toward 3rd Street, Costantino said, with two black male occupants one of whom had dreadlocks. Police attempted to stop the vehicle but it sped off toward West Avenue. The vehicle was ultimately found unoccupied on Holly Lane behind the YMCA with the engine still running, Costantino said.. No arrests have been made but police have a person of interest and are actively investigating the shooting.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":85,"startIndex":78,"value":"ELYRIA "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":261,"startIndex":253,"value":"1:51 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Urbana police are looking for the person or people responsible for shots being fired in an east Urbana neighborhood earlier this week. Police were called to the same neighborhood just south of Washington Street twice within about four hours. Lt. Rich Surles said just before 11 p.m. Monday, officers found five spent casings near the intersection of Hunter Street and Austin Drive. Then, about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, officers were called back to the 1100 block of Austin Drive where an unknown person fired at least four rounds, Surles said. In both cases, officers received no reports of property or people being hit. ???What???s most concerning is we have two in the same area, pretty close in time. Each time, we recovered 9 mm shell casings,??? Surles said. The lieutenant described the shooting sites as a ???neighborhood we are concerned about,??? given the frequent number of calls police handle in that area. Anyone with information is asked to call the Urbana Police Department at 217-384-2320 or Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477. Information may also be sent anonymously online at www.373tips.com or by cellphone text message by sending CCTIP plus the information to CRIMES (274637). Crime Stoppers will pay a reward if the information leads to an arrest. Cash rewards are also paid for information on other felony crimes or fugitives in the Champaign County area.

1017	http://www.wadenapj.com/news/region/3945699-fargo-officer-shot-expected-die	Fargo officer shot, expected to die | Wadena PJ	Fargo officer shot, expected to die | Wadena PJTodd said at a 2 a.m. Thursday news conference at police headquarters that Officer Jason Moszer, 33, is a six-year veteran with the police department. He was shot by a suspect in a standoff with police at a north Fargo residence, just blocks from the police department. "Tonight the Fargo Police Department is mourning the loss of our brother officer," Todd said. Moszer would be only the second Fargo police officer fatally shot in the line of duty in the city's history, the only other death coming in 1882. In a press conference at 7:30 a.m., Todd confirmed that the suspected shooter has died, either from gunfire from police or by suicide. Police haven't identified the suspect publicly but believe they know who he is. Todd also said he believes the gunman was purposely shooting at police while barricaded inside a north Fargo home, noting a police cruiser nearby was also shot multiple times. "I don't think there was anything random about it," he said. Because of the Fargo Police Department's involvement, the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Cass County Sheriff's Office will take over the investigation of the shooting, Todd said. "Right now my job as the chief is to take care of our officer's family and to take care of my officers," he said. Todd said Moszer has a wound that is not survivable. He is married with two children, he said. "His family is with him, they're saying goodbye to him," the chief said. The area near the standoff in the 300 block of Ninth Avenue North is still considered the scene of an investigation and travel there will be limited Thursday, both on foot and by vehicle, Todd said. The standoff lasted around eight hours. In a statement shortly after 6 a.m., Todd said the standoff in north Fargo has been resolved and there was no longer a threat to the public. Deputy Chief Joe Anderson, a Fargo police spokesman, said at 4 a.m. he did not know if Moszer had died, but said "he won't pull through." What initially began with a report of a domestic disturbance at 308 9th Ave. N. about 7 p.m. escalated quickly. The armed man holed up in the north Fargo home opened fire on officers and continued to unleash bursts of gunfire in a residential neighborhood as authorities tried to negotiate with him, police said. Anderson said at 4 a.m. that the operation was still ongoing and it was unclear if the suspect was alive or dead. "As far as I know we haven't even made it inside yet," Anderson said. "At this point, we're treating it as if he is still alive." No additional gunfire was heard from the home since an initial media briefing around 10:40 p.m. Wednesday, Anderson said. There had been no other officers injured, he said around 4 a.m. Thursday. The SWAT team used two robots, gas and smoke to try to flush the suspect from the home, Anderson said, though the robots were having battery and other malfunctions. Temperatures hovered in the single digits above zero early Thursday. At a 5:30 a.m. news conference, Todd said authorities did have negotiations with the suspect and that a SWAT operator "did engage him with gunfire. it is possible the suspect was hit with gunfire. We do not know what his status is." Earlier in the night, Moszer was hit by the suspect's gunfire and was seen by a neighboring resident lying in an alley nearby a police cruiser, Todd said. At the 7:30 a.m. news conference, Todd said Moszer was one of the officers who had set up a perimeter around the house and that he was shot before the SWAT team arrived. Officers moved in with an armored BearCat vehicle and took Moszer to the hospital, said Todd, who went with Moszer's wife to the hospital where they were informed he was mortally wounded. "Tonight we're losing a brother, one of our fellow officers," Todd said, choking back tears. Moszer graduated in 2001 from Fargo South High School and from North Dakota State University in 2009. In 2012, Moszer and fellow officer Matthew Sliders were awarded the department's Silver Star Medal for pulling two children from an apartment fire. "He was a guy who came to work with a smile on his face every day," Todd said. "He loved working out on the street with his fellow officers, they loved working with him. He was just an all-around great guy. It's a terrible loss," Lt. Joel Vettel said a funeral for Moszer is expected to take place late next week. Todd said the suspect is believed to have threatened his wife in the home and possibly shot at her. The couple's son made the initial call to police, Todd said. Family members were able to escape the gunfire unharmed, Anderson said. When police arrived and established a perimeter around the home, the man opened fire on officers, said Anderson. Shots continued to be heard as police, including SWAT team members, tried to resolve the situation. It was uncertain what sort of guns and ammo the man had access to. "He has possibly multiple long guns, but that's not confirmed at this point, but we do know that he is obviously shooting rounds out of his house," Anderson said. About 9 p.m. Wednesday, police sent out an emergency alert to north Fargo residents warning them to stay in their homes and go into their basements. Some homes in the area were being evacuated about 9:30 p.m. "If the individual is firing a long rifle, those rifle rounds can go through houses, go through wood," Anderson said. Around 12:30 a.m. Thursday, SWAT team officers were going door-to-door in the neighborhood, asking residents if they were OK and telling them to remain in the lower level of their residences. That sweep appeared be completed around 1:45 a.m., scanner traffic indicated. The home where the standoff was taking place was just north of Sanford Medical Center, hospital spokesman Darren Huber said. Huber confirmed the downtown hospital was on lockdown at one point. He said patients and families could still enter on the south side escorted by security. A short distance to the west, near First Lutheran Church, at least a dozen police vehicles were staged, including Fargo and West Fargo police, North Dakota Highway Patrol, Cass County Sheriff's Office and the Red River Regional SWAT team command truck. Last police officer shooting death in 1882 There's been only one Fargo officer to be shot and killed in the line of duty. Frederick D. Alderman was slain July 5, 1882, after just two months on the job. According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, Alderman, 25, was shot as he attempted to follow a suspect who had used stolen property to pay a fine. With no issued lantern, Alderman mistook a neighboring home for the suspect's residence in the dark. After receiving no response to a knock on the door, Alderman forced the door open and the resident opened fire on him, killing him at the scene, the website report said. A woman was charged with murder but a jury ruled against the charge upon learning Alderman did not identify himself as a police officer at the door. Moszer, fellow officer honored in 2012 In 2012, Moszer and officer Matthew Sliders were awarded the department's Silver Star Medal for pulling two children from an apartment fire. Responding to a disturbance call in November 2011, the officers found two children trapped and screaming inside a burning apartment bedroom. Risking their own lives, the two officers entered the room and saved the children from the fire, and then helped extinguish the blaze in the apartment. At the ceremony, then-Police Chief Keith Ternes said all officers recognized had gone above and beyond what is normally required of them. "Some of the events these officers were summoned to - we don't teach people to run into a burning building, we don't teach people to save lives," Ternes said. "They did that because of who they are."

As Crump related, police put on breathing masks and entered the home, only to be shot at by the attacker. Dozens of fire units are at the scene, which is near North 43rd Avenue and West Cactus Road. The shooter ignited a raging fire and was still inside. Family members told investigators that Alex Buckner, who lived in the home, had received treatment in Oklahoma for drug abuse. Flames woke up neighbors, and cops rushed to the burning house and desperately ran inside to rescue victims in a hail of bullets. The violence played out in a cul-de-sac of quiet, suburban family homes Tuesday morning. A 26-year-old man shot four of his family members and set their Phoenix, Arizona house on fire before he was killed by the police. Howard says police tried to get her to drop the gun but she pointed it two officers, prompting one to shoot her. The caller said her brother shot her. Investigators will continue gathering evidence at the house, Crump said. Strayhand gathered clothes, medications and her mother's walker, and they both evacuated the scene. "I've seen an active shooter inside a home while the house is on fire, shooting at officers that are trying to help victims who are on the line with us". Crump said police were called to the scene at about 4:45 a.m. (0645 ET) after receiving a 911 call from a female inside the home about a shooting. Police said the gun Buckner used to kill his family belonged to his father and had been at the home and is believed to be the only gun in the home. "We have a lot of work, as you can imagine", said Crump in an emailed update. Gunfire erupted and the flames grew as officers entered the scene. They took the shooter's body with them. When first-responders arrived, they found the house afire. Crews were working a first-alarm fire at the home, as well. "This is a family that is just devastated", Yahner said. They said Buckner had a troubled past but seemed to be getting better. Graham said he saw a boy or young man in his late teens or early 20s from time to time. They would chat a bit before the girl went back to her house. "She was bright", Bustamante said. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton issued a statement on the tragedy. He said: 'This is what heroes look like. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols sought to defuse the controversy, dismissing the backlash as "desperate politics". And he sought to bolster his credentials as an independently-minded politician.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":61,"startIndex":54,"value":"Phoenix"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1469,"startIndex":1460,"value":"4:45 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-26","details":{"endIndex":395,"startIndex":356,"value":" North 43rd Avenue and West Cactus Road"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":812,"startIndex":801,"value":"26-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":504,"startIndex":491,"value":" Alex Buckner"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":812,"startIndex":801,"value":"26-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":504,"startIndex":491,"value":" Alex Buckner"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AP1CRKA54S84U

Each 10th-grader was found with one gunshot wound outside the building, near the school’s cafeteria, Glendale police Officer Tracey Breeden said. A weapon was found near the bodies, Breeden said. When reporters asked whether this was a homicide-suicide or a double suicide, Breeden said she “can’t confirm anything,” but she said investigators don’t believe any shooter is at large. “We don’t believe that there’s any suspects that are out there … that we’re searching for,” Breeden said. Breeden said she didn’t know what relationship, if any, the girls had. [Original story] Two teenagers were shot Friday morning at a high school in Glendale, Arizona, prompting authorities to lock down the building as they investigated, police said. “It’s been stabilized, and students are not in (further) danger,” Glendale police Officer Tracey Breeden told reporters about the shooting at Independence High School. Details about the teens’ identities, their conditions, and whether police had anyone in custody weren’t immediately available. The shooting happened at a covered patio area near the main building before 8 a.m., Breeden said. Breeden said she didn’t know whether the teens who were shot were students at the school. “The incident was isolated. The school and neighborhood are safe,” Glendale police said on Twitter. Police asked students’ parents to gather at a nearby Walmart to await further information. Video from CNN affiliate KNXV-TV showed scores of people gathered in the store’s parking lot as well more standing across the street. “Our prayers are with the students, educators & families at Independence High School & all the first responders on the scene,” read a post on Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s Twitter account. Independence High School opened in 1977 and is part of the Glendale Union High School District. More than 2,000 students are enrolled. Glendale is a city of about 230,000 just northwest of Phoenix.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":305,"startIndex":256,"value":"Each 10th-grader was found with one gunshot wound"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":232,"startIndex":224,"value":"Glendale"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1370,"startIndex":1365,"value":"8 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-12","details":{"endIndex":220,"startIndex":196,"value":"Independence High School"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":183,"startIndex":174,"value":"morning\u2019s"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":135,"startIndex":124,"value":"15-year-old"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":135,"startIndex":124,"value":"15-year-old"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":135,"startIndex":124,"value":"15-year-old"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2VPAI1545GXWC

Aaren O'Connor was 25 years old. She moved to Chicago a year and a half ago for a good job and her boyfriend. She had just returned home from work Friday night and was sitting in her car outside her home in the 2000 block of West 21st Street. A fight broke out nearby, shots were fired and a bullet hit Aaren in the back of the head. She was on the phone with her family in San Diego at that moment. They didn't know what was going on. “I'll never see her in a wedding dress. I'll never talk to her again.

Said Aaren’s boyfriend, Carlos Sorto, “I thought she was gorgeous and she was definitely perfect. Definitely the most gorgeous woman I'll ever see.” Her murder adds to an already troubling pattern of violence in the first part of 2016.

State Highway Patrol officials tell the Columbus Dispatch the man shot himself outside the front door of the Statehouse on Monday evening. Lt. Craig Cvetan says 23-year-old MarShawn M. McCarrel II, of Franklin Township, died at the scene. McCarrell was not a state employee. Cvetan says it’s unclear why the man killed himself. Authorities say nobody saw the shooting, but the man was seen on Statehouse grounds just before the gunshot. McCarrell was a young mentor, organized events to feed area homeless and participate in the Black Lives Matter movement, the Dispatch reported.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":69,"startIndex":61,"value":"COLUMBUS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-08","details":{"endIndex":274,"startIndex":234,"value":"outside the front door of the Statehouse"},"state":"OH - Ohio","time-day":{"endIndex":292,"startIndex":285,"value":"evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":318,"startIndex":316,"value":"23"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":351,"startIndex":328,"value":"MarShawn M.

Independence police say they started to pursue a stolen vehicle out of the city late Thursday night. The stolen car eventually crossed into Kansas City, Mo., where police officers there assisted with stop sticks in the area of 99th and Blue Ridge. The stop sticks disabled the vehicle's tires, after which the suspect fled the vehicle on foot. "Our officers used tire deflation devices in the area of 99th and Blue Ridge," said Sgt. Kari Thompson of the KCPD. "Those worked and the vehicle finally came to rest with the suspect inside at 113th Terrace and Blue Ridge." In the middle of the foot chase, the suspect turned toward an Independence police officer with a firearm in their hand, according to a statement from the Kansas City Police Department. The Independence officer responded and shot the suspect. Kansas City Fire Department personnel declared the suspect dead on the scene. No officer was hurt in the incident.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":73,"startIndex":62,"value":"KANSAS CITY"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":408,"startIndex":374,"value":"in the area of 99th and Blue Ridge"},"state":"MO - Missouri","time-day":{"endIndex":261,"startIndex":242,"value":"late Thursday night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3VMFCG9L3XOB2
1152	http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-allentown-cop-shot-homicide-investigation-20160217-story.html	Allentown police said cop shot during homicide investigation - The Morning Call	Allentown police said cop shot during homicide investigation - The Morning CallALLENTOWN — Barbara Roman did the dishes Tuesday night while her grandson got ready for bed and her husband watched the news, but their routine evaporated when a gunfight broke out next door. "I heard a bang-bang going on next door and I got scared and we ran to the back," said Roman, who has lived in the apartment on North Godfrey Street in east Allentown for nine years. As she huddled in the back of her apartment with her family, Roman frantically called 911, only to be told that police were already at the apartment building at 616 N. Godfrey St. According to city police, detectives investigating the homicide of a woman found Sunday in a nearby recycling bin went to the apartment of Roman's neighbor to execute a search warrant and were met by gunfire. An Allentown detective was shot in the arm and police returned fire, critically wounding the shooter. Neither has been identified, but police said the detective was released from the hospital and is "doing well." They said the shooter was in the hospital in critical condition. The woman found dead Sunday has been identified through fingerprints, but her name will not be released until relatives are notified, the Lehigh County coroner's office said Wednesday. Authorities said the man who shot at police barricaded himself inside the apartment for three hours before officers stormed in early Wednesday and arrested him. Charges against him are pending. When asked if that man is a suspect in the woman's killing, police declined to comment. Police Chief Keith Morris confirmed that the wounded detective and the officers with him were serving a search warrant in connection with the death of the woman, who was shot several times. Tuesday night's gun battle happened about two blocks from where the woman's body was found at 2:45 p.m. Sunday. Since her body was discovered, neighbors said, police have been canvassing the normally quiet neighborhood that includes Dieruff High School, a youth athletic field and the east Allentown fire station. Several people said they've seen their neighbor, who told them he was a military veteran and a minister, with someone who fits a description of the dead woman, described as petite and of Asian descent. Roman said she was freaked out by the shootout at her neighbor's apartment. "I can't believe that something like that could happen here," she said. Roman said her neighbor moved into the apartment in the summer and lived alone for a month or two. She said she remembers her neighbor once told her, "I don't want to be alone; I need my wife to be here with me." Soon after, a petite Asian woman moved in with him and they appeared happy, Roman said. Roman said she didn't have many long conversations with either of them, but said they talked about church often. She said he played the drums and would sometimes knock on her door to ask if the noise bothered her. She said she last saw the woman about two weeks ago. Roman said she was not aware of the investigation that followed the discovery of a woman's body in the recycling bin until after the Tuesday night shootout. County Coroner Scott Grim reported the woman found dead in the bin had been shot several times. In initially seeking the public's help in identifying her, Grim described her as 5 feet tall and weighing 119 pounds. She wore a green sweater, black dress pants, Nike sneakers and had scars on both forearms, Grim said. The woman also wore several pieces of jewelry, including a bracelet with the inscription, "A daughter is a little girl who grows up to be a friend." Her age had been difficult to estimate. The coroner's office had said she could be 18 to 30 years old. Tom Follweiler, a retired city worker who lives in the neighborhood, said that when he saw the description of the dead woman, he immediately thought of the woman he's seen walking down Graham Street. Her clothes stuck out because she wore slacks with sneakers, but she appeared older than the age given by the coroner's office, Follweiler said. He never called police, assuming someone else did because she was quite noticeable in the neighborhood. The woman walked with a man, both hunched as they carried shopping bags, he said. Follweiler said he last saw the woman two weeks ago, but he saw the man alone Tuesday morning. "Yesterday, I seen him by himself and usually they're together," Follweiler said. "I was looking over at him and he saw me looking at him and he said, 'What's up?'" After an awkward silence, the man told Follweiler, "God bless," and left. Hours later, Follweiler learned of the shootout. It happened about 9:45 p.m. as a police Emergency Response Team tried to serve the search warrant, Morris said. "As members of the ERT were approaching the door, they were met with gunfire," Morris said Wednesday morning after the standoff had ended. "One of our officers was struck. There was an exchange of gunfire at that point in time. The returned fire struck [the gunman] as well." According to emergency radio reports, the wounded detective managed to walk a block with assistance and with a tourniquet on his arm. He was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest with a wound to his left arm and later released. After hearing the commotion and calling for help, Roman looked out her window and saw a police officer who yelled, "Get out of there!" Roman and her family were evacuated through a window and placed in a bus to stay warm as the neighborhood swarmed with additional police, paramedics, firefighters and flashing lights. A Bearcat tactical armored vehicle was stationed on the east side of the apartment house while heavily armed officers lined up on the west. To get a closer look at the building, the fire department bomb squad sent in a tiny robot at midnight. Police tried to talk with the gunman but, according to police radio chatter, he expressed no interest in coming out on his own. At 12:55 a.m. Wednesday, police smashed a window and about six officers climbed inside, sealing off the west side of the house. Then, at 1:05 a.m., police set off a flash-bang grenade on the east side of the house and entered that side. The gunman was taken out on a stretcher to an Allentown EMS ambulance, which soon was gone. The bomb squad and most of the police packed up to leave, and a few officers stayed behind to guard the crime scene. Police remained at the apartment house Wednesday morning and removed several items, including evidence boxes used to hold rifles and handguns. It was the second time in three days that residents of the east Allentown neighborhood saw a swarm of police vehicles, yellow caution tape and news reporters. "I'm right in the middle of this — first with the body and then with this guy," said Adrian Aponte as she walked with her mother down East Tilghman Street. Aponte, 26, was headed home with her 9-year-old son and her mother after having a Valentine's Day lunch at a diner on Union Boulevard when they were stopped by police tape, detectives and a coroner's van investigating the death of the woman whose body was dumped in the recycling bin. Aponte said they had just walked past the recycling bins on their way to the diner, calling it a shortcut behind the east Allentown fire station. She didn't notice any odor or signs that a body was there. Aponte said she has no vehicle and regularly walks the quiet neighborhood, often past the apartment where Tuesday's night shootout happened, to get to a dollar store and past the recycling bins to get to her night job at a nearby convenience store. "It's going to be pretty scary to walk this way, especially at night," she said. On Wednesday morning, Allentown police and Mayor Ed Pawlowski gave an update on the wounded officer's condition, praised him for his bravery and thanked the community for its concern. "The Allentown Police Department deeply appreciates all the well-wishes and calls from citizens of this great city offering assistance in any way they can," Allentown police posted on Facebook. "It is times like this that bring communities together." In his statement, Pawlowski said he wished the officer a speedy recovery. "When we induct new police officers, I always tell them and their families that I pray for their safety every day," the statement reads. "Our officers do a fantastic job, many times in difficult circumstances. I am in awe of their courage, and last night's incident is a perfect example of why."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":88,"startIndex":79,"value":"ALLENTOWN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-16","details":{"endIndex":632,"startIndex":615,"value":"616 N.

1153	http://wtvbam.com/news/articles/2016/feb/21/several-people-shot-killed-in-random-michigan-shootings-reports/	Seven people now dead after Kalamazoo man goes on cross-county killing spree	Seven people now dead after Kalamazoo man goes on cross-county killing spree(Reuters) - Seven people were shot and killed and several others wounded in Michigan on Saturday night in a series of apparently random public shootings, according to authorities and local media. The Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety said on its Facebook page that six people had been shot and killed and several others seriously wounded in three shootings in Kalamazoo County, in southwest Michigan. Local media said early on Sunday a teen-aged girl who was shot had died, becoming the seventh fatality. "We seem to be dealing with a worst-case scenario, someone driving around shooting," Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas told NBC News after the shootings. At least three people were wounded in the attacks. The Kalamazoo Public Safety Department said a suspect fitting the description of the gunman had been apprehended without incident, citing Chief Jeff Hadley. The suspect was not identified, but media reports, citing police, said he was aged 45, from Kalamazoo. The public safety department earlier described the gunman as a white male in his 50s who was believed to be driving a dark colored Chevy HHR SUV with chrome wheels, adding that the vehicle may have been damaged. Police said the man who was arrested was driving a black HHR and had a weapon in the vehicle. According to local media, four people were shot dead at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Texas Township, and two more died at a Seelye Kia dealership in Kalamazoo. The teen-aged victim who later died was also shot at the restaurant. The carnage began early Saturday evening when Matyas said police were first called to a Kalamazoo County apartment building where a woman was shot multiple times before later being listed in serious condition. Hours later, they were called to the car dealership where two people were shot and killed, and a third was wounded. Four people were killed at a third shooting scene in the Cracker Barrel parking lot, where the gunman opened fire on people in their cars after a brief conversation. A fifth person died later. The victims and shooting scenes appeared to have no link apart from the suspect. No motive for the seemingly random attacks had been determined. Authorities could not be reached to verify the reports independently, but confirmed the deaths in media interviews and on social media. The victims' identities were not released.

1171	http://www.citypages.com/news/some-asshole-shot-this-golden-lab-in-the-face-8073349	Golden Lab shot in face in central Minnesota, suspect at large | City Pages	Golden Lab shot in face in central Minnesota, suspect at large | City PagesStearns County is looking for some sort of monster who took it upon himself to shoot pellets into an innocent doggy. On Monday, someone who lives just north of the little central Minnesota town of Avon called the county sheriff to report a stray dog. The dog, a male Golden Lab, was lying under a tree when his rescuer found him. For reasons beyond the finder, the sheriff, and anyone with a heart in their chest, the dog had been shot repeatedly with a pellet gun. The dog took two in the butt, and four shots in the face, busting through a muzzle the dog had been wearing, and breaking its jaw. The dog is otherwise OK, and is now in the care of the county, after being treated by a veterinarian. The Golden Lab is in possession of at least one squeaky toy which involves a soccer ball, and another one that's bright red. It has also been convalescing on a plaid blanket. Stearns County authorities have two questions about the incident: Who is the dog's rightful owner? And which one of you assholes did this?

The victim, who has not been identified, was gunned down Sunday outside a Baptist church in Fairfield, which is part of the Birmingham metro area. Fairfield Police Chief Leon Davis said investigators believe the victim's phone was stolen from his car and he used an app to track it to a vehicle at the parking lot. There, he confronted his alleged thief and the suspect shot him twice in the chest, Davis told NBC station WVTM. "If you have an app on the phone, contact your local police department. Let the police do their job and recover your stolen property," Davis said. "Don't take these matters into your own hands — these things normally don't turn out too good." Officers were called to the Crumbey Bethel Primitive Baptist Church at 7:20 p.m. and the victim was transferred to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Law enforcement officials are now hunting a suspect who goes by the street name of "G Boy" or "G Bo," although they do not know his actual name, according to the police chief. He may be driving a 2015/16 Nissan Maxima that is gold or "brownish" in color, and has chrome trim around its sunroof, Davis added.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":599,"startIndex":594,"value":"twice"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":316,"startIndex":307,"value":"Fairfield"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":966,"startIndex":957,"value":"7:20 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-21","details":{"endIndex":953,"startIndex":914,"value":"Crumbey Bethel Primitive Baptist Church"},"state":"AL - Alabama","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1131,"startIndex":1126,"value":"G Boy"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":65,"startIndex":62,"value":" 23"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A18ZUFGMNOVI2Y

Collision NBC affiliate WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan reports the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety have taken Jason Dalton, 45, into custody in connection to a shooting spree that killed six people, including one child, Saturday night. Police say Dalton drove around in a vehicle and fired a gun at people at three locations, including a Cracker Barrel Restaurant, according to reports. NBC News reports police responded to the first shooting around 6 p.m. Saturday after a woman was shot several times at an apartment complex. The final shooting occurred in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel where four women were killed and a 14-year-old girl was gravely injured, according to NBC News. Paul Matyas, the Kalamazoo County Undersheriff, said the shooting victims were not targeted. “There is no connection between any of them, this all appears to be random,” he said. “This is the worst-case scenario that any community can have.” According to NBC News, investigators believe one gunman was responsible for all of the shootings.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":6793,"startIndex":6784,"value":"Kalamazoo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":6532,"startIndex":6525,"value":" 6 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":6670,"startIndex":6656,"value":"Cracker Barrel"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":6202,"startIndex":6200,"value":"45"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":6198,"startIndex":6186,"value":"Jason Dalton"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":6717,"startIndex":6706,"value":"14-year-old"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A3I3F5BPVCPEQT

1205	http://www.greeleytribune.com/news/20818723-113/breaking-news-man-reportedly-shouted-shoot-me-kill	Early-morning police-involved shooting shakes up Evans neighborhood | GreeleyTribune.com	Early-morning police-involved shooting shakes up Evans neighborhood | GreeleyTribune.comE VANS ??? Rey Garcia noticed the red and blue of police lights illuminating the darkness when he got home from work early Thursday. As he started to unwind from his night, the gunshots rang out. Outside, police officers had just shot a man across U.S. 85 from Garcia???s garden-level apartment near the intersection of 37th Street and the highway. It was scary. ???I???ve never seen anything like that,??? he said, as investigators processed the scene that afternoon. Multiple officers went over the scene, took photos and searched the grass and road with a metal detector all day, activities that kept the mile-long stretch of the highway closed throughout day. Garcia shook his head at the scene: ???And then there was the shooting last year up the street and now this.??? It all started hours before. At about 1:25 a.m., Evans officers noticed a suspicious vehicle near U.S. 85 and 40th Street. Officers found two men nearby. After several minutes, one suspect fled and the other ??? whose name authorities have not released ??? was arrested, according to a news release. Evans officers gave chase, and they lost sight of the fleeing suspect as he crossed a fence north of the scene. They called for assistance, and LaSalle and Greeley police officers, along with Weld County sheriff???s deputies, arrived to help surround the area. About 2:47 a.m., officers found a man who, when confronted by an Evans officer, shot at the officer and fled, the release stated. About 30 minutes later, officers spotted the suspect again and confronted him. The man shouted ???shoot me, kill me,??? and pointed his gun at officers, according to the release. Initial reports show that two Greeley officers and one LaSalle officer fired their guns at the man. It is unknown how many shots were fired. Shortly thereafter, officers began CPR on the man. An ambulance took him to North Colorado Medical Center???s emergency room. He was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m. The Weld County Coroner will release the identity of the man after proper notifications have been made. Greeley police Sgt. Joe Tymkowych said the man was a ???parole absconder??? and was wanted on felony charges. JoAnne Guerrero, who lives just a few blocks south of Garcia, said she heard the shots too. Minutes later, she received an emergency message on her phone telling her to stay inside; she watched as police vehicles arrived at the intersection. U.S. 85 remained closed to drivers throughout the day. Police finally re-opened the highway to traffic before the evening rush hour. Police tape surrounded 85 Liquor, 3705 W. Service Road, and the nearby Mariscos Y Tacos El Tapatio, 1012 37th St. Farther south on U.S. 85 near 39th Street, more police tape cordoned off Wireless Advanced Communications, 3901 W. Service Road. As the sun moved down the sky that afternoon, authorities kept a detour in place to keep traffic moving. This is the second police-involved shooting in Evans in 13 months, and the seventh in Weld County in two years. Garcia recalled the shooting just across the highway from his home a little more than a year ago, in January 2015. Two officers ??? from the Evans and LaSalle police departments ??? shot and killed Michael Rodriguez, 39, at Paradise Billiards, 818 31st St., in Evans, just a few blocks north of Thursday???s shooting. Weld District Attorney Michael Rourke cleared the officers involved in that shooting. The Weld Critical Incident Response Team, created by legislation last year, will conduct the investigation of this officer-involved shooting. The team is reviewing body camera footage of the incident, Tymkowych said. Police have not released the names of the officers involved in this incident. They were placed on administrative leave.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1847,"startIndex":1840,"value":"unknown"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":54,"startIndex":49,"value":"Evans"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1439,"startIndex":1431,"value":"2:47 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-19","details":{"endIndex":435,"startIndex":392,"value":"intersection of 37th Street and the highway"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":259,"startIndex":254,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3BQF3FSRCQHYX
1224	http://fox17online.com/2016/02/10/man-charged-in-muskegon-heights-shooting/	Man charged after shooting outside Muskegon Heights High School | Fox17	Man charged after shooting outside Muskegon Heights High School | Fox17MUSKEGON, Mich. — Clarence Jamichael McCaleb, 21, was charged Wednesday for a shooting that left four others injured following a Muskegon Heights basketball game Tuesday night. Investigators say it appears that McCaleb was the only person in the incident, other than police, who had a gun. McCaleb was arraigned on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, felony firearm and carrying a concealed weapon. He was charged as a third-time habitual offender, and faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted. The Muskegon County Prosecutor's Office says he could face additional charges. According to the Muskegon County Prosecutor, McCaleb was confronted by a Muskegon County Sheriff's Deputy after the initial shooting that left four people wounded, including two Muskegon Heights students. The deputy wounded McCaleb in the confrontation. The prosecutor's office says that the investigation so far shows the deputy took the necessary action to save his life and save others at the scene. According to detectives, McCaleb told them that he had gone to Muskegon Heights to watch the basketball game. He ran into a group of people at the game and went out to his car to get a gun. He told police that when he tried to leave, the group of people ran at him and he fired shots into the crowd. Officials say McCaleb fired at least three shots, then ran away and fired into the air. Muskegon Heights High School will be closed again Thursday. Superintendent Alena Zachary Ross said that all four victims were innocent bystanders who were walking back to their cars after the game. It’s too bad the Deputy wasn’t a better shot. He could have got the scum off the street forever and saved the tax’s payers a lot of money. 12 whole years for a habitual offender who shot people…that’s what, 4 years with good behavior. If the “suspect” chose random innocent targets, would that not be terrorism? The Superintendent herself said the shooting was connected to the on-line banter.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":173,"startIndex":167,"value":" four "},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":79,"startIndex":71,"value":"MUSKEGON"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":1476,"startIndex":1447,"value":"Muskegon Heights High School "},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":246,"startIndex":241,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":119,"startIndex":117,"value":"21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":115,"startIndex":89,"value":"Clarence Jamichael McCaleb"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A3H48TMCITL94X

According to a police report, at around 7.15 a.m., residents heard explosions. Upon checking in an area known as “the mall”, they found King motionless, bleeding from gunshot wounds. Inspectors Ramkhelawan and Ramphal and Sergeant Ramjag led a party of officers of the La Brea and Point Fortin CIDs, and Homicide Division Region Three to the scene. Police said they were working on a theory that King may have stolen a quantity of cocaine, known as a “rock”, from someone in the area which led to his killing.

A man drove around Kalamazoo fatally shooting several people at multiple locations Saturday, police said. Authorities identified the shooter as Jason Dalton. (Mark Bugnaski/Kalamazoo Gazette-MLive Media Group via AP) LOCAL TELEVISION OUT; LOCAL RADIO OUT; MANDATORY CREDIT KALAMAZOO, Mich. — The Latest on the shootings in the Kalamazoo, Michigan, area (all times local): 10 p.m. Mourners streamed into a Kalamazoo church for a special prayer service after a shooting rampage that rocked the western Michigan community. The service Sunday night at Centerpoint Church was intended to honor the victims and help residents cope. It comes a night after authorities say a 45-year-old area man fatally shot six people and wounded two others in three incidents around Kalamazoo. The lieutenant governor, area pastors and others spoke during the service, which also included several musical numbers. Pastor Brian Stone told those in attendance it's natural to ask why such a tragedy would happen and said there is "no easy answer." 6:45 p.m. Mattawan Consolidated Schools Superintendent Robin Buchler says her close-knit western Michigan community is mourning the loss of high school senior Tyler Smith. The 17-year-old was killed Saturday night along with his father, Richard, outside of a Kalamazoo car dealership. They were among six people shot and killed in three incidents around Kalamazoo. Buchler says Tyler Smith spent half of each school day at a technical center focusing on marketing. She adds that her son, also a senior, describes his classmate as "well-liked" with a constant "smile on his face." Buchler says the challenge for educators and administrators will be helping students "still believe in the world," and assuring them "they can still be safe in this town." 5:30 p.m. Western Michigan University's president says the Kalamazoo school failed to provide adequate information and updates after a series of shootings miles from the campus. At least six people were killed in the shootings Saturday and two others were wounded. John Dunn says Sunday in a letter to the campus that Western did not issue an alert about the shootings and that the system is set up to warn of threats to the campus and people on it. Dunn says the school needs to adjust its "procedures to respond to extraordinary circumstances." Western also is looking at the possibility of developing a public safety advisory to cover broader public safety issues. A campuswide forum is scheduled for Monday night. Forty-five-year-old Jason Dalton was arrested early Sunday in connection with the shootings. 4:10 p.m. A neighbor of Kalamazoo shooting suspect Jason Dalton says he knew the man had a pistol because the two of them "talked about it." James Block tells The Associated Press that police carried boxes from the house next door Sunday morning. The 45-year-old Dalton of Kalamazoo Township was arrested early Sunday in connection with the fatal shootings Saturday of at least six people and wounding of two others at three separate locations. Block said he and Dalton would talk at the fence separating their properties, and that Dalton was an insurance adjuster who did auto body damage estimates. Block said Dalton was home "between the shootings" Saturday because his niece saw Dalton pull out of his driveway about 7 p.m. The first shooting occurred about an hour earlier. 3:40 p.m. A neighbor describes one of the six people killed in the shooting rampage in Kalamazoo as friendly and giving. Patrick Mallon Jr. says he didn't know 74-year-old Dorothy Brown well but what he did know he liked. After she moved in two doors down in Battle Creek about 10 years ago, the woman everyone knew as Judy would come over with herbs she grew. Mallon says she would always wave and say hello when she drove off to the mall, where she walked. Mallon says whenever he and his wife went on vacation, Brown would keep an eye on the house and feed their cat. Mallon says Brown had two grown sons, with one living in California and the other in Florida. 3:10 p.m. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder says a 14-year-old girl wounded in a shooting rampage in the Kalamazoo area is "working hard to stay alive." The governor visited hospitals Sunday to meet with her family and the family of another victim. He says the girl has "all our thoughts and prayers," and the shooting is "senseless violence at its worst." The girl was shot at a Cracker Barrel parking lot along with four women who were killed. A father and son were fatally shot at a car dealership. Snyder says the girl was part of a group returning home after seeing a play and "someone comes up and shoots them." 2:45 p.m. Kalamazoo police say they contacted the wife of the man suspected of going on a shooting rampage that left six people dead to make sure she was safe. Department of Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley says investigators contacted the wife of 45-year-old Jason Dalton Saturday evening "to make sure she wasn't a victim." Hadley adds that she has cooperated with police in their investigation. Police say the rampage began about 6 p.m. Saturday outside an apartment complex on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County, where a woman was shot multiple times and seriously wounded. A little more than four hours later and 15 miles away, a father and son were fatally shot while looking at vehicles at a car dealership. Fifteen minutes after that, five people — including a 14-year-old girl, who was wounded— were gunned down in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant. 2:20 p.m. A man who knows the suspect in the random fatal shootings of at least six people in Michigan says he never showed any signs of violence. Gary Pardo Jr. tells The Associated Press that Jason Dalton is "a family man that for all intents and purposes seemed to stick with his family." Pardo says Dalton is married and has two children. Pardo's parents live across the street from Dalton in Kalamazoo Township. The 45-year-old Dalton was arrested early Sunday. A woman was seriously wounded Saturday evening outside an apartment complex. A father and son were slain four hours later at a car dealership. Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded 15 minutes later in a restaurant parking lot. 2 p.m. Kalamazoo shooting victim Mary Jo Nye is being remembered as a teacher who could help even the most reluctant students become better writers. The 60-year-old retired teacher who lived in Battle Creek, Michigan, was identified by authorities as a victim in the shooting rampage. Tara Egnatuk, assistant director of the Calhoun Community High School, said she worked for six years with Nye at the alternative school that serves many at-risk students. Egnatuk says that Nye helped write the charter to create the school. Egnatuk spent hours in Nye's classroom and was mentored by her during the time they worked together. She says Nye was able to get students to become better writers by taking "baby steps" to get them to open up. She adds that Nye "played a really integral part in a lot of kids' lives." 1:50 p.m. Uber says the man suspected of going on a shooting rampage that left six people dead was one of its drivers. But spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian would not say whether 45-year-old Jason Dalton was driving for the ride-sharing service on Saturday when the shootings occurred outside an apartment complex, a car dealership and a restaurant. Uber's Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan says the company is "horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence" and that Uber has contacted police to offer assistance in the investigation. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says authorities are investigating a Facebook post that the suspect was an Uber driver who was driving erratically around the time of the shootings. He would not elaborate because of the ongoing investigation. Uber also released its firearms policy that prohibits both drivers and passengers from carrying firearms in an Uber vehicle. 1:30 p.m. The next-door neighbor of a woman shot first in a rampage that left six people dead says she and her family heard the shooting, ran outside and her neighbor "was on the ground." Tammy George tells The Associated Press that four bullets went into a closet of her apartment, where her son was playing video games with two friends a few feet away. George says her neighbor was lucky to be alive considering the number of shell casings authorities found. The woman has not been identified. Police say she was shot multiple times and was seriously wounded in the rampage that began about 6 p.m. Saturday outside the apartment complex on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County. George says she made sure the woman's children were OK and told them that their mother was talking and asking about them. Forty-five-year-old Jason Dalton of Kalamazoo County was arrested early Sunday in Kalamazoo in connections with the shootings. 12:40 p.m. Authorities have released the names of four people killed inside two vehicles parked near a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Kalamazoo during a shooting rampage that left six people dead. Michigan State Police say the victims were 62-year-old Mary Lou Nye of Baroda and 60-year-old Mary Jo Nye, 68-year-old Barbara Hawthorne and 74-year-old Dorothy Brown, all of Battle Creek. A 14-year-old girl also shot in the restaurant lot remains in critical condition. State police say four of the victims were inside a Chevrolet Cruze and the fifth victim — Mary Lou Nye — was alone in an Oldsmobile minivan nearby. The shooting happened shortly before 10:30 Saturday night and was the last of three separate shootings. The suspect in the shootings, 45-year-old Jason Dalton, has been taken into custody. 12:15 p.m. A Michigan prosecutor says authorities are investigating a Facebook post that the suspect in a series of random shootings that left at least six people dead was an Uber driver who was driving erratically around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting says he is aware of the post regarding 45-year-old Jason Dalton of Kalamazoo County. Getting added that it is part of the investigation, but he was not prepared to discuss it. Getting says Dalton likely will face multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder in connection with the shootings Saturday. Dalton is expected to appear Monday before a judge in a Kalamazoo County courtroom. He was arrested early Sunday in Kalamazoo. Uber did not immediately comment but a spokesman says they are preparing a statement. 10:50 a.m. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder says "the victims and their families — and the entire Kalamazoo area — should be in everyone's thoughts" after a shooting rampage that killed at least six people. Prosecutor Jeff Getting says 45-year-old Jason Dalton likely will face multiple first-degree murder and attempted murder counts. Dalton was arrested early Sunday. The shootings started Saturday evening outside an apartment complex where a woman was seriously wounded. A father and son were slain four hours later at a car dealership. Four people were killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded 15 minutes later in a restaurant parking lot. Snyder in his statement Sunday also lauded police, saying "their actions resulted in the suspect being caught before he was able to harm anyone else through these senseless and apparently random acts of violence." 8:55 a.m. Authorities expect the suspect believed to be responsible for a series of random shootings in western Michigan that left at least six people dead will be arraigned Monday afternoon.

Residents in the 300 block of East Yager Lane said they learned about the naked teen on their subdivision's Facebook page. "I saw on the Facebook page, our residence Facebook page there was a lot of suspicious activity like a young man running naked through the neighborhood," said resident, Rebecca Luna. Police say people at a nearby apartment complex also reported seeing a suspicious man. Myneeka Holloway told KXAN, when she saw the man, "he had all his clothes on, so I went and took a shower." However, the Austin Police Department said when officers arrived on scene, the man was naked in the middle of the street and acting strangely. "Giving him commands the subject did not comply with the commands that this officer was giving and instead charged at the officer," Assistant Police Chief Brian Manley said at a Monday afternoon media briefing. Police said the officer responded by opening fire. Neighbors heard the gunshots. "I heard two loud noises and I asked my wife and I'm like what is that and she's like, I didn't hear anything, okay, right after that that's when we heard the slew of sirens that were coming by," said Ernest Holloway. The initial encounter was captured on a police dash cam, Manley said, but it failed to capture the moment the suspect allegedly charged at the officer and the shooting that followed. The suspect died at a local hospital. The officer is on administrative leave per department protocol.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":37,"startIndex":31,"value":"Austin"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Yes","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

1291	http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_29524010/twin-peaks-killings-richmond-man-charged-murder	Richmond man charged with murder in Twin Peaks killings - ContraCostaTimes.com	Richmond man charged with murder in Twin Peaks killings - ContraCostaTimes.comSAN FRANCISCO -- A 26-year-old Richmond man has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder after a shooting in the Twin Peaks neighborhood that killed two people and left a third critically injured, police said Tuesday. Richard Contreras also has been charged with carjacking, being a felon in possession of a firearm and aggravated assault with a gun, police said. Police arrested him Monday at his home in an undisclosed part of Richmond. Santa Rosa residents Julio Peraza, 21, and Rene Mora, 19, were killed in the shooting, which police responded to around 2:06 a.m. Sunday. The third shooting victim, an 18-year-old, was clinging to life Sunday, and his condition has not changed, San Francisco police spokesman Officer Albie Esparza said. Police continue to investigate the shooting. Contreras was also a suspect in a crash involving a stolen vehicle and an AC Transit bus in September 2014 in the 700 block of 18th Street, said Richmond police Lt. Andre Hill. Eleven people were injured as a result of the crash and a neighborhood was evacuated for 10 hours due to a gas leak. The Richmond man was traveling west on Burbeck Avenue when he realized he was being followed by police and sped up. The bus was heading north on 18th Street and the driver attempted to dodge the speeding car, but clipped its edge and crashed into a house. The bus barely missed striking a 3-month-old boy by a few feet. Contreras fled the scene and left his juvenile brother in the passenger seat, Hill said. He later pleaded guilty to joy riding, hit and run, and probation violation charges. Hill said he wasn't surprised when he heard Contreras was suspected of shooting three people because "he put himself in a position where he could have killed himself" and his brother. "I don't know what the circumstances were in this shooting, but it definitely fits his demeanor," Hill said. Staff writer Katrina Cameron contributed to this report.

A man reportedly committed an armed robbery, stole some cash, and left in a Jeep Wrangler. "officers responded to that area and within a minute they located the vehicle that was described as being involved in the robbery they tried to stop the vehicle at that point the driver fled and a pursuit began" Auburn Police Chief Paul Register said authorities chased the Wrangler for several minutes after the suspect refused to pull over. Officers even tried using stop sticks to disable the Wrangler before the pursuit turned even more dangerous. "at one point during the pursuit the suspect fired a shot at law enforcement officers and then there was a shot fired in return to that vehicle" Chief Register said no officers were injured in the shooting and the shot hit an officer's vehicle. Not long after authorities said the chase ended on Gay Street near Brookside Drive when the suspect's Wrangler collided with an SUV. "at that point the driver did a self-inflicted gunshot to himself and died there on the scene" Chief Register said it's not often they involve themselves in a police chase, but in this case authorities felt it was necessary. "when we have someone like this individual that his intent is to possibly harm others and is armed with a weapon and robs people at that point it becomes a matter of you can't let that person escape you have to pursue, until you end that threat" Authorities said a woman and child hit by the suspect's Wrangler were treated for injuries and have since been released from the hospital.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":125,"startIndex":119,"value":"AUBURN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-23","details":{"endIndex":188,"startIndex":166,"value":"3000 block of Cox Road"},"state":"AL - Alabama","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1160,"startIndex":1149,"value":"the driver "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AP1CRKA54S84U

1328	http://framingham.wickedlocal.com/news/20160205/court-rules-framingham-officer-not-immune-in-shooting-lawsuit	Court rules Framingham officer not immune in shooting lawsuit - News - The Framingham Tab - Framingham, MA	Court rules Framingham officer not immune in shooting lawsuit - News - The Framingham Tab - Framingham, MAThe ruling means the family and estate of Stamps can still sue Duncan in U.S. District Court for violating Stamps’ Fourth Amendment rights when Duncan shot and killed the 68-year-old retired transit worker on Jan. 5, 2011. Duncan, through his lawyer Leonard Kesten, had argued the SWAT team officer was immune from liability because he was both acting in his role as a police officer and the shooting was accidental. An accidental shooting would not be a violation of someone’s Fourth Amendment rights. Stamps’ family argued the act of pointing a loaded gun with a finger on the trigger at a man who was lying face down on the floor and presented no danger violated Stamps' rights. A U.S. District Court judge ruled against Duncan, and the U.S. Appeals Court affirmed the lower court’s ruling. “The district court denied the motion, holding that a reasonable jury could find that Duncan had violated Stamps' Fourth Amendment rights and that the law was sufficiently clearly established to put Duncan on notice that pointing a loaded firearm at the head of an innocent and complaint person, with the safety off and a finger on the trigger, is not constitutionally permissible," the Appeals Court Ruling said. "We agreed with the district court and affirm the denial of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity.” Kesten said he was “disappointed but understood,” the appeals court’s decision. “I do agree that a police officer shouldn’t stand over the head of someone with their hands on a trigger. We all agree. We say he wasn’t,” said Kesten. Kesten argued that Duncan tripped while trying to step over Stamps, who was prone on the floor of his apartment after police broke down the doors in a raid. Kesten said the only person who said Duncan was standing directly over Stamps with his finger on the trigger was a ballistic expert hired by the Stamps family. “The concept that he was standing there with a gun and his finger on a trigger pointing at someone’s head has been pulled out of thin air,” said Kesten. “Our ballistic expert disagrees.” Page 2 of 2 - Those groups applauded the court’s ruling on Friday. "This is a landmark decision. It confirms that, when police officers needlessly put members of the public at risk, the lives of those civilians matter," said Matthew R. Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. "Victims of undue police violence deserve constitutional protection, and this opinion says that they have it." He also said the case could go to trial and Duncan could appeal a verdict in that civil trial. Kesten said a jury would have to believe Stamps’ expert. If they do not, the judge would have to rule there was no violation of Stamps’ Fourth Amendment rights, Kesten said. He said there has been no decision made on the next step. “We’re just digesting the ruling,” Kesten said Friday afternoon. At the time of the shooting, Duncan was a member of the Framingham Police Department’s SWAT team. Police were serving a drug warrant on Stamps’ stepson, Joseph Bushfan, and his friend Dwayne Barrett. Duncan was ordered to watch Stamps, while other officers searched the house, when the shooting occurred. Then-Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone's office ruled the shooting accidental, after an investigation. "Duncan's actions are symptomatic of a larger problem in policing,” said Hall. “The way in which the police engage communities of color reveals bias and a general lack of empathy, which can oftentimes have deadly results. The reason activists take to the streets declaring 'Black Lives Matter' is because of cases like this."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":86,"startIndex":75,"value":"Framingham "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MA - Massachusetts","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Officer Olszewski, a seven-year veteran of the department, was assigned to the Essex precinct. Baltimore County police officers are identified by last name only, per an agreement with the county police union. The shooting happened about 2 a.m. at Old Eastern and Harrison avenues after an officer stopped a vehicle on suspicion of drug activity. The man who was shot was a passenger in the car. According to the department, Olszewski has not been involved in any previous shootings, and will remain on administrative status while the incident is reviewed. Officials Friday said they will release surveillance video taken from surveillance video of a nearby businesses that depicts the shooting. Police spokeswoman Elise Armacost said the department is waiting until Monday to release the footage because Police Chief Jim Johnson "wants the people central to this investigation to be able to view and evaluate the video before it becomes public and is subject to public comment." "The need for transparency always must be balanced against the need for a fair and thorough investigation," Armacost said in an e-mail to The Baltimore Sun. The driver that was stopped in the incident as Timothy Eric Dudeck, 29, of Middle River, police said. He is facing multiple drug- and gun-related charges. Officers found suspected oxycodone pills, cocaine, and $1,800 on him, police said. Dudeck has been released on $100,000 bail. No attorney is listed for him in online court records, and he could not be reached for comment. Police said that after Dudeck's 2006 Nissan Altima was stopped, a male passenger got out, began walking toward Eastern Avenue and then stopped. The car turned onto Harrison Avenue and pulled up so it was parallel to the police car. According to police, the person who had been the passenger "suddenly placed his hand into his waistband area and turned toward the officer," causing the officer to believe that he was reaching for a weapon. The officer shot him at least once. The department would not say where he was shot. Initially, police said they found no weapon at the scene. After executing a search warrant of the vehicle, they found a handgun, scale, and more than $400 in cash. The man who was shot will face charges in connection with the incident but has not been formally charged, police said. He remained hospitalized Friday.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":2190,"startIndex":2177,"value":"at least once"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":202,"startIndex":189,"value":" Middle River"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":446,"startIndex":440,"value":" 2 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-19","details":{"endIndex":16,"startIndex":0,"value":"Baltimore County"},"state":"MD - Maryland","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":221,"startIndex":204,"value":"Officer Olszewski"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A38OYO6BYY7F7J

Jones County deputies responded to a prowler call at McCaw's home on Barron Russell Road in Juliette. Major Earl Humphries says Woodard's parents did not know where he was. "They were aware that he was gone from home," said Humphries. "They had no idea that he was at that location." Humphries says McCaw's roommate first noticed a person lurking on their property. That's when Humphries says McCaw approached Woodard, and told him to leave. "It appeared initially that when the juvenile attempted to leave, and then immediately turned and faced Mr. McCaw, at which time he felt threatened, and according to his statement, fired a single gunshot at the juvenile," Humphries said. He said deputies found a butcher knife on Woodard. "There was a knife involved," Humphries said. "Mr. McCaw did not specifically see a knife. He stated he saw something in the young man's hand." Humphries says they also found a toy gun and bow. Woodard was wearing camouflage and a camo mask. They're still investigating, but McCaw has not been charged in the case. "We believe that he was responding to the prowler, intruder, on his property and took what action he needed to or he deemed at the time appropriate, whether that behavior is right or wrong, that's what happened," said Humphries. The sheriff's office says they're still not sure what Woodard was doing outside the home that night, but Humphries did say Woodard lived about a mile down the road and did mention Woodard was bipolar. Neither he nor the Assistant Coroner, Matt Jarratt, could comment on any other health issues Woodard may have been dealing with. Humphries says this is an ongoing investigation. UPDATE: Jones County Sheriff's Office have identified the man who shot a 14-year-old boy to death Saturday. That man is Randy McCaw. McCaw's roommate saw the child, Jonathan Luke Woodard, "lurking" on the secluded property and McCaw tried to approach the boy, said Jones County Sheriff's Maj. Earl Humphries. Investigators said they do not know what was said during the exchange between McCaw and the child, but said the shooter told deputies Woodard walked away and then turned around facing McCaw. Humpheries said McCaw told investigators that he then felt threatened. The shooting happened at about 11:30-11:45 p.m. Saturday. The child lived near the property where the shooting occurred. No charges have been filed and the case is still under investigation. PHOTOS: Property where Jones Co. child was shot A Jones County14-year-old was shot to death outside of a home near Juliette late Saturday. That's according to Matt Jarratt, the chief assistant coroner for Jones County. He said Jonathan Luke Woodard was outside of a home on Barron Russell Road, wearing camouflage and a face mask. When the homeowner came home,Jarratt said he confronted the boy. He said Woodard charged at the homeowner who shot him. Jarratt said the boy was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and had other disabilities. Jarratt said Woodard never spoke to the man. This story is still developing.

1438	http://fox6now.com/2016/02/15/jury-trial-begins-monday-for-darrin-malone-accused-in-shooting-death-of-gas-station-clerk/	Jury trial begins for Darrin Malone; accused in shooting death of gas station clerk | FOX6Now.com	Jury trial begins for Darrin Malone; accused in shooting death of gas station clerk | FOX6Now.comWAUKESHA -- A jury trial began Monday, February 15th for 29-year-old Darrin Malone -- charged in connection with a fatal shooting that occurred at the Citgo gas station in Waukesha last January. Malone was charged with felony murder (as party to a crime, repeater) for his alleged role in the shooting death of 65-year-old Saeed Sharwani of Brookfield. On January 13th, 2015, two masked men robbed the Waukesha gas station near Whiterock Avenue and Moreland Boulevard. Prosecutors say one of them was Malone. They say the other was Kenneth Thomas -- who allegedly shot and killed the store clerk. Malone is charged with felony murder even though he did not pull the trigger -- because someone died while a crime was being committed. Jerica Cotton, the alleged getaway driver, is also charged with felony murder (as party to a crime). Kenneth Thomas faces a number of charges, including: Police say Malone went into the gas station on the night of the robbery/fatal shooting — following behind Thomas. Cotton, police say, was the getaway driver. According to the criminal complaint, Malone supplied the masks that were used in the crime. Thomas told police “Malone was behind him (when they walked into the gas station) and that the clerk started freaking out and so did he. Thomas stated that the clerk ran out as he climbed over the counter. Thomas stated that the clerk then came around and grabbed him and the next thing he knew, the gun went off.” The complaint indicates that Malone asked Thomas “if he did it on purpose and Thomas said no.” Police arrested Thomas, a convicted felon, in West Allis less than 10 hours after the shooting. Cotton was also quickly apprehended. Darrin Malone, however, was on the run until February 23rd, 2015 — more than a month after the shooting. Police believe Thomas and his accomplices were involved in at least six robberies in four jurisdictions. Their crime spree touched the communities of West Allis, Milwaukee, the Town of Brookfield and the city of Waukesha. Cotton and Thomas have jury trials scheduled to begin on February 23rd.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":2053,"startIndex":2044,"value":"Milwaukee"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-15","details":{"endIndex":277,"startIndex":269,"value":"Waukesha"},"state":"WI - Wisconsin","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":156,"startIndex":153,"value":" 29"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":179,"startIndex":166,"value":"Darrin Malone"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":643,"startIndex":629,"value":"Kenneth Thomas"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":410,"startIndex":408,"value":"65"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":434,"startIndex":420,"value":"Saeed Sharwani"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1YNGQXMGLM9L7

1445	http://www.wthr.com/story/31242251/death-investigation-underway-at-zionsville-home	UPDATE: Woman, young child found dead inside Zionsville home - 13 WTHR Indianapolis	UPDATE: Woman, young child found dead inside Zionsville home - 13 WTHR IndianapolisZIONSVILLE, Ind. - The prime suspect in the deaths of a woman and young child found inside a Boone County home is now also dead, by his own hand. Boone County authorities said Katherine Janet Giehll and her 4-year-old son Raymond Peter Giehll IV, were found dead shortly before 9 a.m. Wednesday at a Zionsville home in the 6800 block of Old Hunt Club Road. Boone County Sheriff Mike Nielsen said Wednesday was Katherine's 31st birthday. "It absolutely makes me sick to my stomach," he said. "In my 32 years in law enforcement, I have never witnessed a crime so heinous and heartbreaking." Police tracked Wabash College employee Lucius Oliver Hamilton III to a downtown Indianapolis hotel room Wednesday afternoon. The 61-year-old was later found dead inside that hotel room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. "We were able to track Hamilton down to a specific location in downtown Indianapolis where he cowardly took his life instead of choosing to face justice for his actions. My heart goes out to the Giehll family and to those first responders that had to witness this horrific scene today," said Sheriff Nielsen. Hamilton was Katherine Giehll's uncle. Investigators believe that the motive for the killings is connected to a long-simmering dispute over a family trust, with millions of dollars involved. "I think there's millions of dollars involved here. All I can tell you is, I don't want to get into specifics at this time, it is from a family trust and it's a lingering issue that's been going on for the last few years," said Sheriff Nielsen. Nielsen promised that his investigators would document every detail to bring justice to the family. Karen McCausland knew Giehll from the years she worked at Karen's veterinary clinic. "She was just the nicest and sweetest person. I never heard a mean word come out of her mouth," McCausland said. "I was just...it just breaks my heart." For neighbors in Zionsville, the news spread that a financial dispute led to the murder of the mother and her child. "It's horrible. I don't know what to say," said neighbor Chrissy Wiseman. Classes at Wabash College were canceled in the wake of the initial crime and the campus was temporarily placed on lockdown. "This is a very tragic event," said Sheriff Nielsen earlier in the day. "As you can understand, this is a serious matter, and we need to handle it perfectly. We are utilizing multiple agencies to assist with solving this crime and we will exhaust every resource to help investigate this to the fullest." Neighbors said they don't remember seeing the accused killer at the Giehll's house before. They knew the victims and his dad, who was not home at the time of the attack. "My gosh, yeah, I can't even imagine. They were quiet neighbors. They were great. I saw the guy, waved to him when he went to work in the morning. Yeah that's awful. That's just heartbreaking," said neighbor Elisha Krug. By the time armored police vehicles left Hamilton's house, police had already tracked the accused killer to the Hilton downtown, where officers say he killed himself. "Shocked. Lu has always been, Lu and Liz, his wife, have always been very, very nice. So this comes as a real big shock," said family friend Steve Harlow. Hamilton lived in horse country, was active in a local hunt and riding club and was on staff at Wabash College. Before he was traced to the downtown hotel, police had his family's old horse farm under surveillance, right behind Harlow's property. "I'm just kind of in disbelief," Harlow said. For the neighbors, "we become closer," Wiseman said, "It's difficult. I don't know what to say." Unofficial timeline of events (from Boone County Sheriff's Department:) In the early morning of January 17th, 2016 Katherine Giehll sent her husband Raymond Giehll III a text that her uncle, Lucius Hamilton, was at their home. After Mr. Giehll was unable to reach his wife on the phone, Giehll accessed his in-home cameras via his cell phone. Giehll noticed Hamilton inside of the residence and after several more failed attempts to reach Katherine, Mr. Giehll, being concerned for his family's well-being, drove to the house. Mr. Giehll arrived home to find his wife and son deceased and he immediately called 911. Giehll notified the 911 operator that Hamilton was previously inside the residence. Around 11:30am, detectives were given video surveillance footage of Hamilton's Saab SUV leaving the home of the deceased. (The exterior surveillance cameras are designed to record to a DVR however the interior cameras only give a live stream to a specific device.) Investigators were able to positively identify Hamilton by checking the recorded DVR in the garage which identified Hamilton. Investigators also discovered a substantial family trust that the victims were beneficiaries of, as well as Hamilton. (The details of the trust are complex and are currently being looked into). Once authorities positively identified Hamilton as a prime suspect, local law enforcement as well as detectives from the Boone County Homicide Task force checked Hamilton's place of employment at Wabash College. After it was determined that Hamilton was at the school but had since left, Wabash was placed on lockdown. It was determined that Hamilton drove his Saab to the school and then checked out a work van. Through an extensive investigation by multiple surrounding and federal agencies, law enforcement officials determined Hamilton had checked in to the Hilton [Hotel] in downtown Indianapolis. Within minutes of that confirmation, US Marshals had arrived on scene and secured the floor. The Indiana State Police SWAT team arrived shortly thereafter and began tactical measures to make contact with Hamilton. Upon knocking on the door, SWAT officers reported two shots fired. After several more attempts to contact Hamilton verbally, they entered the room. Hamilton was found deceased with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. A handgun was recovered at the scene and is currently being processed by crime scene investigators. Autopsies were performed on Katherine and Raymond IV [Wednesday] night by the Boone County Coroner's Office. The Coroner's Office stated that Mrs. Giehll sustained 3 gunshot wounds and Raymond one. Both vehicles driven by Hamilton are currently being processed by crime scene investigators. This continues to be an ongoing investigation that is extremely complex and involves multiple agencies. At this point there will be no more information released unless there are major developments in the case. Sheriff Mike Nielsen stated: "This has been a very emotional time for the family, and our first responders. My main goal today was to make sure that the emotional health of all first responders were addressed. We did this by attending a Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) meeting this morning. This debrief was conducted by our CISM team, and chaplains, conducted at the Lebanon Fire Department. We then conducted an after-action review of the incident this afternoon. We have a plan to move forward and continue to conduct this very complex investigation."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":6036,"startIndex":6027,"value":" handgun "}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":55,"startIndex":45,"value":"Zionsville"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":366,"startIndex":361,"value":"9 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-17","details":{"endIndex":438,"startIndex":420,"value":"Old Hunt Club Road"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":3792,"startIndex":3784,"value":"morning "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":803,"startIndex":800,"value":" 61"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":738,"startIndex":710,"value":" Lucius Oliver Hamilton III "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":507,"startIndex":505,"value":"31"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":282,"startIndex":259,"value":"Katherine Janet Giehll "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":291,"startIndex":290,"value":"4"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":328,"startIndex":304,"value":" Raymond Peter Giehll IV"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":803,"startIndex":800,"value":" 61"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":738,"startIndex":710,"value":" Lucius Oliver Hamilton III "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

Mishler, 40 years old, and William A. Mishler, 42. They were brothers who lived together, according to police officials. Jacob Kelsey has lived in the Sherwood Apartments at 301 West Lawrence Street for about three months, and never imagined he’d bear witness to a double homicide. Kelsey says he’s absolutely shocked and like many, is now wondering why such a violent incident occurred. “Pretty crazy. Didn't really expect that just coming from home from the store.” Kelsey recalled, “We heard yelling and arguing down the hallway and followed by three to four gunshots.” Kelsey and his friend had made a trip to a convenience store. Upon returning to Sherwood Apartments, Kelsey recalled passing by the suspected killer in the main floor hallway, spotting the gun. Kelsey said, “We walked by the gunman, he was holding a rifle or shotgun, one of the two.” He then locked the door to his apartment, turned off the lights and called 911 after hearing what happened just down the hall. Not alone, Kelsey’s mother and friend were also with him during the shooting, huddled on the ground, riding it out. Police found the brothers dead on the main floor. HPD and Sheriff’s deputies scoured the apartment complex and eventually discovered 43-year-old Tilmon R. Nungesser IV in the basement, and arrested him for deliberate homicide. The gun used in the shooting was also recovered by law enforcement. Police are continuing to investigate the case, interviewing potential witnesses, and gathering further evidence. Autopsies of the Mishler brothers will be performed on Monday.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":748,"startIndex":735,"value":"three to four"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1026,"startIndex":1009,"value":" rifle or shotgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":84,"startIndex":78,"value":"Helena"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-20","details":{"endIndex":386,"oldEnd":385,"oldStart":337,"startIndex":338,"value":"Sherwood Apartments at 301 West Lawrence Street "},"state":"MT - Montana","time-day":{"endIndex":173,"startIndex":165,"value":" evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1423,"startIndex":1420,"value":" 43"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1455,"startIndex":1433,"value":"Tilmon R.

A 22-year-old man was shot and killed at the Landau Plaza Jan. 31, a home and two cars were shot at last Friday and a 47-year-old man is recovering after being shot twice at Sky Blue Water Trail Monday night. All of the shootings happened on or near Ramon road. "That is very scary to us because it's a little too close to home," said Tim Atcheson, manager of Don & Sweet Sue's Caf?? in Cathedral City. Don & Sweet Sue's Caf?? has been in business for 22 years on Ramon Road. Atcheson said as the city grows, so does the crime, which surrounds the restaurant. The safety of his employees and customers are a priority. ??"Our parking lot is well lit, our building is well lit. Our restaurant is well lit. It's busy and active," said Atcheson. Noe Suarez grew up in Cathedral City said he knows which areas to avoid and when. "At night, usually when more crime happens, there are areas you just don't want to be in. It's just dark and you could potentially run into something you don't want to be a part of," said Suarez. Cathedral City police said the crimes are not related and they are working diligently to solve them. While officers ask for your help to come forward with any information, Atcheson wants more help from police. "Hopefully the Cathedral City Police Department will cruise the area a little more especially in the evening," he said. CCPD told News Channel 3 & CBS Local 2 it doesn't have the option to put more officers on the street, but it will have its on-duty officers circulate the area more often and for longer periods of time.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":401,"startIndex":395,"value":" twice"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":174,"startIndex":160,"value":"Cathedral City"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-12","details":{"endIndex":425,"startIndex":405,"value":"Sky Blue Water Trail"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":438,"startIndex":433,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":235,"startIndex":233,"value":"22"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":351,"startIndex":349,"value":"47"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME
1525	http://www.denverpost.com/money/ci_29565516/sheriff-kansas-gunman-kills-3-wounds-14-dies	Sheriff: Kansas gunman kills 3, wounds 14, dies in shootout	Sheriff: Kansas gunman kills 3, wounds 14, dies in shootoutHESSTON, Kan. (AP) — A gunman armed with an "assault-style" weapon drove through a south-central Kansas town, taking shots at people, before storming the factory where he worked. Authorities said he killed three people and wounded 14 before being shot dead by an officer. All the dead were shot Thursday inside Excel Industries, a plant in Hesston that makes lawn mower products, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. Of those hurt, 10 were critically wounded, he said. Walton would not identify the suspect or discuss a motive but said there were "some things that triggered this individual." The shooting came less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in the Kalamazoo, Michigan, area, leaving six people dead and two severely wounded. The shootings began about 5 p.m. when the gunman was in a car and shot a man on the street in the nearby town of Newton, striking him in the shoulder. A short time later, another person was shot in the leg at an intersection. "The shooter proceeded north to Excel Industries in Hesston, where one person was shot in the parking lot before he opened fire inside the building," the department said in a release. "He was seen entering the building with an assault-style long gun." Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the attack. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm. Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran. "I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company," Espinoza told The Associated Press. "After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him." A Hesston officer responding to the scene exchanged fire with the shooter, who was killed. The officer was not injured. Walton said that about 150 people were likely in the plant at the time of the shooting and that the law enforcement officer who killed the suspect "saved multiple, multiple lives." He said the gunman also had a pistol. The officer who killed the man is "a hero as far as I'm concerned," Walton said. Erin McDaniel, spokeswoman for the nearby city of Newton, said the suspect was known to local authorities. She wouldn't elaborate. A nearby college was briefly locked down. Later Thursday night, several law enforcement vehicles surrounded the suspect's home in a Newton trailer park. The Harvey County Sheriff's Department initially said authorities believed the suspect's roommate could be inside. But McDaniel, the Newton spokeswoman, said later that the standoff had ended and no one was inside. Hesston is a community of about 3,700 residents about 35 miles north of Wichita. Excel Industries was founded there in 1960. The company manufactures Hustler and Big Dog mowing equipment and was awarded the Governor's Exporter of the Year award in 2013 from the Kansas Department of Commerce. Gov. Sam Brownback issued a statement late Thursday, calling the shootings "a tragedy that affects every member of the community." Walton said the FBI and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation had been called in to assist. A spokeswoman for the Kansas City office of the FBI did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday night. "This is just a horrible incident. ... There's going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over," Walton said. Associated Press writer John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, contributed to this report. Fisher reported from Kansas City, Missouri.

George Greenwood Willinger III, 37, of Middle River, remains hospitalized after the Feb. 18 shooting at Old Eastern and Harrison avenues, police said. Willinger was in a car driven by 29-year-old Timothy Eric Dudeck when they were stopped by an officer for suspected drug activity. Willinger exited the car after the stop. The officer, identified by police as Officer Olszewski, shot him when Willinger made a move toward his waistband, according to the department. Olszewski believed Willinger was reaching for a weapon, police said. Police did not find a weapon on Willinger. After executing a search warrant, police found a gun on the back seat and suspected drugs in the vehicle driven by Dudeck, who is facing gun and drug charges. Police say they found suspected drugs and pills on Willinger. He is charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, as well as gun-related charges. Police would not release the name of the hospital treating Willinger. Members of his family could not be reached for comment. The department does release the first names of officers involved in shootings, per an agreement with the county police union. County employment records list an officer named Jordan Olszewski. Once police complete their investigation of the shooting, they will hand over their findings to the state's attorney's office. The shooting was captured on surveillance video from a nearby business and the footage was released this week. alisonk@baltsun.com twitter.com/aliknez	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":56,"startIndex":47,"value":"Baltimore"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-18","details":{"endIndex":322,"startIndex":290,"value":"Old Eastern and Harrison avenues"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":1416,"startIndex":1400,"value":"Jordan Olszewski"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":220,"startIndex":218,"value":"37"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":216,"startIndex":186,"value":"George Greenwood Willinger III"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2H64NAG24NV7C

Wohlford was not struck by the bullet and retreated back inside the home, where he barricaded himself in a bedroom, sheriff’s officials said. Deputies and a sheriff’s service dog were eventually able to enter the home and take Wohlford into custody. He was wanted on warrants for alleged assault with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest, according to the sheriff’s department. Wohlford was taken to a hospital to be treated for a minor dog bite, authorities said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":684,"startIndex":681,"value":"one"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":128,"startIndex":119,"value":"BOULEVARD"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":500,"startIndex":492,"value":"4:15 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":448,"startIndex":400,"value":" 4600 block of Kumeyyay Road near state Route 94"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":314,"startIndex":307,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":183,"startIndex":181,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]}]}	A38OYO6BYY7F7J

1624	http://gazette.com/the-latest-man-who-shot-deputies-had-sued-over-foreclosure/article/feed/319979	The Latest: Man who shot deputies had sued over foreclosure	The Latest: Man who shot deputies had sued over foreclosureBAILEY, Colo. (AP) — The Latest on the shooting of three deputies in Colorado (all times local): 6:50 p.m. A vigil is underway for a sheriff's corporal who was shot and killed while authorities were trying to evict a man from his foreclosed home in the Colorado mountains. About 100 people gathered at Platte Canyon Community Church in Park County Wednesday night to remember Nate Carrigan. Authorities say Carrigan was killed earlier Wednesday by Martin Wirth, the man who was being evicted. Wirth was also shot and killed. The crowd at the church included football players from Platte Canyon High School, where Carrigan served as an assistant coach. People wrote prayers and messages on sheets of paper on the church walls. One note recalled Carrigan comforting a young girl after a chimney fire at her home and sending a firefighter to the house to retrieve her dolls. "Rest in peace, Cpl. Carrigan. We love you," the note said. 5:10 p.m. A sheriff's corporal shot and killed by a Colorado man authorities were trying to evict from his foreclosed home was a 13-year veteran of the department well known in his mountain community. The Park County Sheriff's Office says Corporal Nate Carrigan was one of three officers wounded after entering the home of Martin Wirth near Bailey, about 45 miles west of Denver. He died at the scene. Another wounded officer is in critical condition, and the other has been released from the hospital. Carrigan is the second law enforcement officer to be killed on duty in Colorado in as many weeks. He was of many officers from around the country who attended the funeral for Mesa County Deputy Derek Geer last week. 3:55 p.m. The man officials say opened fire on three Colorado deputies who were serving an eviction notice had sued the governor and others after losing a court battle over his home's foreclosure. The gunman killed one deputy and wounded two others before dying in a shootout Wednesday in a forested mountain community. In 2013, Martin Wirth sued Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, the state attorney general and a judge, claiming state foreclosure laws are unconstitutional. The federal lawsuit also said Wirth was "in imminent danger of being wrongfully deprived of home and property." He asked a judge to block Park County from selling his home, evicting him or forcibly entering the house and to strike down several state laws. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit last September. 2:20 p.m. Officials say a man who lost ownership of his Colorado home two years ago opened fire on three deputies serving an eviction notice, killing one and wounding the others. The gunman was killed in the shooting. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation says Martin Wirth was the shooter Wednesday. The Park County Assessor's Office says Wirth owned the home in the town of Bailey until March 2014, when Fannie Mae took ownership. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to release information about the investigation. A website for the Colorado Foreclosure Resistance Coalition includes undated posts that Wirth had lost a legal fight against foreclosure and was facing eviction. The website calls for supporters to join Wirth in "non-violent eviction resistance." It wasn't possible to immediately verify the website's claims. A call to the Colorado Foreclosure Resistance Coalition wasn't immediately returned. — From Associated Press writer Sadie Gurman 12:50 p.m. Authorities say three sheriff's deputies were shot as they served an eviction notice in a Colorado mountain community, leaving one deputy and the attacker dead. Susan Medina, spokeswoman for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, says the shooter fired at the deputies with a rifle. One had life-threatening injuries and was undergoing surgery, while the other deputy's injuries were not life-threatening. It's not clear if deputies killed the shooter. The violence happened at a hillside home in the town of Bailey, about 45 miles southwest of Denver. Medina didn't know whether there were other suspects but said there's no danger to the community. She confirms that a bomb squad and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been called in to assist.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":3814,"startIndex":3809,"value":"rifle"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":65,"oldEnd":65,"oldStart":-28,"startIndex":-28,"value":"publication date: 2/23/2016The Latest: Man who shot deputies had sued over foreclosure\nBAILEY"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":3532,"startIndex":3523,"value":"12:50 p.m"},"date":"2016-02-23","details":{"endIndex":4084,"startIndex":4050,"value":"about 45 miles southwest of Denver"},"state":"CO - Colorado","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":2051,"startIndex":2038,"value":" Martin Wirth"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":448,"startIndex":435,"value":"Nate Carrigan"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":2051,"startIndex":2038,"value":" Martin Wirth"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2389DERMNF3ZB

Joe Angel Martinez Jr., 38, and Monica Barrientos, 29, were found dead in the 500 block of Southeast 13th Avenue, police said. Police were dispatched about 11:45 p.m. after neighbors reported hearing a woman screaming and shots fired in the area. Jonathan Edgar said he has lived for several years across the street from where the shooting occurred. Friday night, he said he and his family first heard screaming and then several shots. When he went outside, he said he saw a man with a few small children leaving the blue house across the street and the flashing lights of police cars as officers arrived on the scene. The man told him there had been a shooting and to get back in the house for his own safety, Edgar said. He grabbed his wife and child and went to a safe part of their house. “It made me sick to my stomach,” Edgar said. Another neighbor, Eric Ortiz, said he also heard the screaming and shots coming from across the street. He called police and then walked out to his front porch as officers began arriving. “They were running down the street with rifles,” he said. “It sounded like a war zone.” The first police officer who arrived on the scene saw a man, later identified as Martinez, who appeared to be armed with a pistol, said Lt. Erick Bohannon, coordinator of Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit. The officer said Martinez pointed something at him and then disappeared behind vehicles in a neighbor’s driveway. The officer then heard a gunshot from the area where Martinez was last seen, police said. Martinez was found dead with a gunshot wound to his upper body, police said. Officers then followed up on the screaming neighbors had described coming from inside the house and found Barrientos, dead from what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the upper body. Police worked until mid-morning Saturday to gather details about the shooting. No information about a motive, other people involved or if anyone else was injured was available Saturday. Calls to detectives at the Amarillo Police Department were not answered. This is the first homicide case being investigated by the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit this year. On Jan. 4, Christopher Jennings. 39, was killed in a shooting at 6701 Lair Road, south of Amarillo. The Randall County Sheriff’s Office is investigating that shooting. The last double homicide in Amarillo occurred last year on June 7. Phetkeo Phetkeo, 52, and his wife, Phonsavahn Phetsavahn, 45, were killed in an apparent double homicide at their home at 1216 Jasmine St. in north Amarillo. Nga Lone Aung, 38, was taken into custody June 19 by Liberal Police Department officers during a traffic stop in Liberal, Kan. Lone was charged with the two murders and remains in Potter County jail on a $1 million bond. Anyone with information about Friday’s shooting is asked to call Special Crimes at 806-378-9468.

The Kodiak Police Department released the name of the victim in the Saint Herman harbor homicide in Kodiak, as well as released additional details in the Sunday morning shooting case in that city on Monday. According to the release made by the department, the shooting victim aboard the m/v Katherine on L float at the Saint Herman harbor was identified as Welton Daniel Albers, age 25, of Houston, Texas. The police revealed that at 12:40 am on Sunday morning, they received a 911 call from 26-year-old Everett Grass “who was heard frantically pleading for officer assistance as he had just witnessed his friend shot several times.” Shortly after Grass informed police that his friend had been shot aboard the “Katherine,” they received a second 911 call from 28-year-old Matt Bowe, he told police that he had shot Albers, but informed them that he had shot Albers in self-defense. When police responded to the harbor, they were met by another man, who was identified as 26-year-old Travis Biocic, who informed the officers that Bowe had shot and killed Albers and that both men were still aboard the “Katherine.” When they arrived at the vessel, police reported that, via the police dispatch, Bowe had been given directions to give himself up, which he did upon their arrival. Bowe told police on-scene that “I shot Dan in self-defense, I killed him.” It was at that time that Bowe was advised of his Miranda Rights, police say. Another witness, 21-year-old Nicole Katelnikoff was also found aboard the vessel when officers arrived. She would later tell police that the two men had been arguing prior to the shooting. Officers located Albers halfway out of the crew’s stateroom that Albers and Bowe shared, down and unresponsive. He had suffered five gunshots to his torso and arm. Albers was transported to Providence Kodiak Medical Center, but was pronounced deceased upon arrival. Bowe and the three witnesses were transported to the Kodiak Police Department, where they were interviewed. Following the interviews, Bowe was charged with Murder I. When police secured the scene aboard the vessel, they located a “a loaded AR-15 assault rifle” in the galley near where Albers was found, along with five spent .223 caliber rounds. They also located an unloaded 12-gauge shotgun on the back deck of the vessel. During the investigation, police would find that Bowe had been fired from the vessel on Saturday, the day before the shooting. Police also stated that Bowe had been drinking and had admitted to investigators that he had had “several drinks throughout the day.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":2390,"startIndex":2385,"value":" five"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":2330,"startIndex":2311,"value":"AR-15 assault rifle"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":291,"startIndex":285,"value":"Kodiak"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":627,"startIndex":619,"value":"12:40 am"},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":131,"startIndex":105,"value":"Kodiak Saint Herman Harbor"},"state":"AK - Alaska","time-day":{"endIndex":645,"startIndex":638,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":948,"startIndex":945,"value":" 28"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":967,"startIndex":958,"value":"Matt Bowe"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":570,"startIndex":568,"value":"25"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":562,"startIndex":542,"value":"Welton Daniel Albers"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3FPPZWMQOANR4

Under their new head coach, Justin Stephens, the Crusaders went 18-7 during the regular season. One Coweta man was arrested after firing a shot at a truck with a family inside. On Friday evening, a father was traveling with his two children on Pete Davis Road attempting to find an address. After the driver turned his truck around and came back up the road, he saw a man standing in the middle of the roadway with a firearm in his hand, according to Lt. Col. James Yarbrough with the Coweta County Sheriff???s Office. The driver then ordered his children to duck as he accelerated around the man who then fired a shot at the truck as it sped away, Yarbrough said. After the truck reached the end of the road, the father made sure the children were unharmed, examined the truck for any bullet holes, and called the sheriff???s office. Upon their arrival, investigators said Harold Lee Davenport III was intoxicated and that they also found a shell casing by the mailbox of his home. Davenport told deputies he believed the truck was speeding and his gun went off by accident when he dropped it, according to Yarbrough. Davenport, 33, was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, three counts of pointing a gun at another, and reckless conduct.

Two male suspects were seen fleeing in an unknown vehicle after the shooting in the 300 block of Holly Avenue near San Marcus Street at about 7 p.m., according to the Compton Sheriff's Station. Deputies said the girl was in a crib inside the house when the suspects opened fire into the garage, which was a converted apartment. Multiple witnesses told ABC7 they heard 10 to 12 shots fired. The child was shot in the head, according to the sheriff's department. Officials said the girls's father grabbed her and ran outside where deputies located them. The sheriff's department said the shooting appears to be gang related. Deputies originally stated the child was 3-months-old, but have since said she was 1-years-old.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":581,"startIndex":573,"value":"10 to 12"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":153,"startIndex":146,"value":"Compton"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":352,"startIndex":347,"value":"7 p.m"},"date":"2016-02-08","details":{"endIndex":298,"startIndex":289,"value":"300 block"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":912,"startIndex":911,"value":"1"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2ASLODX49RGP1

Officials said the third officer chased the gunman into an apartment where he was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. "It's another example of what our officers confront every single day keeping us safe, not only in the streets of New York City but in the stairwells and the hallways of our public housing developments", he continued. Following the incident, both officers were listed in stable condition and were reportedly alert, according to police officials. "We also recovered a shotgun in that apartment as well", said NYPD Chief Robert Boyce. Around 8 p.m. local time, three officers entered the Melrose Houses building and split up; an unnamed male opened fire on two of the officers, striking a female cop in the torso and grazing a male officer's face. As many as three suspects are in custody, according to police. Colonel Timothy LaBarge, commander of the 105th Airlift Wing, called the Putnam cop " profoundly professional airman at the 105th Airlift Wing so it does not surprise us at all that he conducted himself with courage and distinction in his duties with the NYPD. Initially there were reports one officer had been shot in the head, but he actually was hit in the stomach, the sources said. During testimony in the ongoing Brooklyn manslaughter trial of rookie Officer Peter Liang - accused in the fatal 2014 shooting of a man in a darkened stairwell of the Louis H. Pink houses - Det. Police said Chavis had 11 previous arrests dating back to 2007 including for drug possession, robbery, grand larceny and criminal trespass. Akai Gurley was on a lower floor walking to the lobby and was struck and killed. Calvin Guzman, 22, a resident of the complex, said he was at work when the shooting happened but was pleased the officers were expected to be OK. Prosecutors say Liang was reckless and shouldn't have had his finger on the gun's trigger. And in October, a police officer responding to a report of shots fired and a bicycle stolen at gunpoint in Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood was killed.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":12,"startIndex":4,"value":"New York"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":692,"startIndex":686,"value":"8 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":755,"startIndex":732,"value":"Melrose Houses building"},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A27LE9HE55KLUF
1717	http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/harford/abingdon/ph-ag-deputy-dailey-funeral-0219-20160217-story.html	Hogan says fallen Harford deputy 'brought honor to his badge every day' - Baltimore Sun	Hogan says fallen Harford deputy 'brought honor to his badge every day' - Baltimore SunHarford County Sheriff's Office Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey was remembered Wednesday as a patriot, a wonderful father and a hero, as thousands of friends, family members and colleagues from across the nation said goodbye to the fallen officer. "By the show of solidarity we see here today, they are proud members of the thin blue line," Gov. Larry Hogan said during Senior Deputy Dailey's funeral at the Mountain Christian Church New Life Center in Joppa. "They bring honor to their badges every day, who come together to lay their colleague to rest." "We show an eternal gratitude of a state that will forever be in his debt," the governor said. Hogan extended his deepest sympathies to Dailey's family and "all those who loved him." "I am representing people of a grateful state to honor the sacrifice of one of our true heroes," said Hogan, who added he is "heartbroken" by a senseless tragedy and a life cut too short. The governor didn't know Senior Deputy Dailey personally, but knows the kind of man he was. "A beloved son, brother, father, cherished friend and a respected member of the law enforcement and volunteer firefighting families," Hogan said. "Maryland owes a debt to Deputy Dailey and to all our men and our women in blue," he continued. "They know that accolades are often too few and the risks are great, but every day, they put on the badge. Every day, they answer the call to serve something far greater than themselves." "For them, that's the job," Hogan said. "Yet when a brother is lost, it is felt by every county deputy, every state trooper, police officer, across this state, across this nation." Senior Deputy Dailey and Senior Deputy Mark Logsdon were shot to death in Abingdon, when they responded to a call about a man with outstanding warrants inside a Panera Bread restaurant. Police say David Evans, 68, shot Dailey inside the restaurant and then Logsdon when Evans fled to a nearby parking lot. Evans was then shot by other deputies. The two deputies violent deaths in the line of duty were the first experienced by the Harford Sheriff's Office in more than a century and have touched off a huge outpouring of sympathy and support for the police from all over Harford County and beyond. During Wednesday's service, Michael Johnson, the Senior Deputy Dailey's nephew, Michael Johnson, asked everyone to stand and say the pledge of allegiance. "I couldn't think of a better way to remember my uncle," Johnson said, using "patriot" as the one word to describe him. He did a fantastic job of raising his boys, Johnson said. "Spending time the last week with these two boys and his extended family has renewed my faith in the next generation," he said. He told a story about "Uncle Choo Choo," a nickname Senior Deputy Dailey earned for all the trains and train gardens set up in his home. Johnson was at Walgreens printing pictures for the upcoming services and as he left, pictures in his arms, a homeless man stopped him out front of the store. Someone who tries to make a habit of speaking of people in need, Johnson stopped when the gentleman approached him. He showed the man one of the photos, of Senior Deputy Dailey in the honor guard. He recognized Senior Deputy Dailey in the picture and just started hugging Johnson. Senior Deputy Dailey went out of his way to take care of him, to check on him, to make sure he had food, Johnson recounted. "I knew my uncle for 38 years, but I learned more about my uncle in those two minutes than I ever did before," Johnson said. "To have a total stranger cry on my shoulder because he was truly saddened and upset, that summed up who he was as a man and as a human being. I couldn't think of a better way to remember my uncle," Johnson said. Senior Deputy Dailey's sons, Bryan and Tyler, spoke as well. "Wow. I just want to thank everybody. I can't thank everyone enough…to all of you, after seeing something like this happen, for getting up and going back to work," Tyler said. Bryan read a poem and afterward said "I can see now, my father was an amazing person. I heard so many stories I've never heard." His father was a very humble man, Tyler said. "I never knew all things he had done," Tyler said. "I knew he was a police officer, or deputy – he'd probably hit me if I said he was a police officer." Tyler said he and his brother "want to do him like he did us as a father." Tyler said he would miss hiking with his dad, going to Gettysburg, walking on frozen lakes – "and almost falling through the lakes" – and going to reenactments – "he turned us both into war nerds." He urged everyone in the room: "If you see someone who needs help, help them, that's what he would do." Sgt. Patrick Vetrone, commander of the Sheriff's Office civil unit where Senior Deputy Dailey worked, recalled meeting him at the police academy and getting to know him better after he moved into the unit. "I relied on him more than on any other deputy in the unit," Vetrone said, adding that Senior Deputy Dailey was easy to talk to. "He knew a little something about everything, maybe that's why we got along so well," Vetrone said. They often talked about wars, hiking, wines and may other subjects. Senior Deputy Dailey is the type of deputy everyone in the Sheriff's Office strives to be, Vetrone said. "He was hardworking, knowledgeable. Above all he had honor," he said. "We are sad and need to grieve, but I ask you to close your eyes and remember his squinty eyes and smile he loved to give." Harford County Executive Barry Glassman had a chance meeting with Senior Deputy Dailey just a few days before he was killed. "He stopped in to check on us at the [county administrative] building," Glassman said. The two made small talk, chatting about the fire banquet season and which one Glassman was going to attend the next Saturday. "He thanked me for going to the banquets just to say thank you, and we wished each other a good weekend," Glassman said. "And now, in the blink of an eye, I'm here to say 'thank you' from a grateful county for giving his life on that winter day." Glassman said Senior Deputy Dailey will be remembered at every flashing light bar in Harford County or the cry of a siren from a fire engine, "still on patrol over his beloved county. "We are shaken, but we are still steady, like those deputies who will carry on in his footsteps, we are brave and not afraid," he said. Like the governor, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said the Sheriff's Office is heartbroken. "However, our agency is not, cannot and will not be broken," Gahler said. "The men and women of this office are heroes, every single one, they continue and have continued since last Wednesday to provide public safety services to our Harford County community. They do it with heavy hearts and tearful eyes, but they do it with unmatched strength and willpower." The thing he was most proud of was his boys. To see them is to see the kind of man he was. "In his final act, he responded to a call to treat kindly a man he did not know and to give his life for the community he loved," Gahler said of the circumstances that led up to the fatal shooting. Law enforcement is a unique endeavor, the sheriff said. "Some say it's a profession, most say it's a calling. I certainly believe it's a calling and I think Pat believed 100 percent it's a calling," he said. "And I have no doubt that other lives, if not for Pat, if not for Mark, would have been lost. In our loss, other lives were saved." Bryan and Tyler Dailey "are the strongest young men I've ever seen," Gahler said. Following the 90-minute funeral service, Senior Deputy Dailey's casket was brought outside where hundreds of uniformed law enforcement officers lined up at attention for an End of Watch Ceremony. Honor guards raised their flags and bagpipers played "Amazing Grace." After a 21-gun salute, a solitary bugler played taps. After eight police helicopters flew over, a 911 Center dispatcher's voice came over a loudspeaker, reciting the fallen deputy's badge number 186 and the time and date when he was fatally shot: 11:56 a.m. Feb. 10, 2016. The casket was placed on the back of the same Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company pumper truck on which it had arrived for the service. A long motorcade, fronted by police motorcycles and consisting of scores of police and fire vehicles, then made its way slowly from the church and north on Route 152 to Fallston, where it turned east on Route 1 and headed to Bel Air, where it turned north onto Main Street. As the procession passed the Sheriff's Office headquarters around 1:30 p.m., people stood solemnly along both sides of Main Street, watching or shooting photos and video with cell phones. At least one person slowly waved a small American flag. The motorcade ended at the McComas Funeral Home on North Broadway. No burial service is planned, according to the Sheriff's Office. The hundreds of law enforcement officers from around Maryland and other states who participated in Wednesday's funeral, some from as far away as New York and Chicago, began showing up early around Mountain Christian. With bagpipes playing in the background, their police vehicles, parked side by side, filled Route 152 in both directions. Senior Deputy Dailey's body arrived at the church on the back of the Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company fire truck, escorted by dozens of police motorcycles. Bryan and Tyler Dailey, both volunteer firefighters like their father, were on the back of the truck for the ride from the funeral home to Mountain Christian Church. Eleven National Capital Park Police officers were mounted on horses atop the hill overlooking the New Life Center. The unit of 11 horses, mostly Clydesdales, not only patrols, but also attends special functions such as funerals. "We are here to honor our brother," Senior Sgt. Mary Devine said. "Each of us recognizes that on any given day that could be us. And we are a family. If anyone in our family is hurt or injured or killed, of course it affects all of us." Cpl. Pat Wilhelm, with the Baltimore County Police Department, said he met Senior Deputy Dailey, who was a member of the Sheriff's Office Honor Guard, during past ceremonies honoring fallen officers. "We are honoring his years of service in law enforcement," Wilhelm said, adding, "It makes you grateful that you're here." It was quiet outside the church as hundreds of officers lined up waiting for the arrival of Senior Deputy Dailey from the McComas Funeral Home in Abingdon. Honor guards from Metropolitan Police in Washington, D.C., Baltimore County Sheriffs Office, U.S. Park Police and University Maryland Police, among others are lined up, flags in hand, with the officers, most of them Harford County Sheriff's deputies. Inside, a slide show of Senior Deputy Dailey, his family and friends played. Thousands of people also visited Mountain Christian's New Life Center Monday and Tuesday to pay respects to Senior Deputy Dailey.

Three Housing Authority officers were patrolling stairwells at the Melrose Houses in the Bronx when they ran into two men. Fire officials say one person is dead and two others are seriously injured after a crane collapse in Lower Manhattan. "I think the police was in the hallway when he shot himself", she said, adding that officers arrived soon after and told everyone to leave of the apartment. The officers were stable and alert at a hospital, Hinton said. "So far, in both cases, their condition is good", Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday night. Mayor de Blasio arrived at Lincoln Hospital shortly after the shooting, having just delivered his State of the City address at nearby Lehman College. He was armed with a.32-caliber handgun and in possession of a sawed-off shotgun in a duffel bag. When responding officers entered the building, they found the gunman dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect turned at some point and fired three rounds at the officers, striking one in the left temple while hitting another in the stomach below her bullet proof vest. Michael Schwartz/for New York Daily News "Proud of Officers Cruz & Espeut", Bratton tweeted with his picture post before Espeut was released. A female officer was grazed in the nose and a male officer was shot in the hip. The accomplice who officers saw in the stairwell remains unidentified. It is unclear how many suspected gunmen were involved but one suspect was dead. Several people who where inside in the apartment at the time were being questioned by police. The head of the police union said Thursday's incident shows just how unsafe such patrols can be. "Vertical patrols" require pairs of officers to sweep the stairwells of public housing projects with flashlights and service weapons, starting in the lobby, climbing the stairwells up to the roof and walking back down. "It's another example of what our officers confront with every single day". During testimony in the ongoing Brooklyn manslaughter trial of rookie Officer Peter Liang - accused in the fatal 2014 shooting of a man in a darkened stairwell of the Louis H. Pink houses - Det. Liang has pleaded not guilty, and his defense has suggested he had his gun drawn because of the unsafe nature of the assignment. Officer Sherrod Stuart was shot in the ankle in on January 9 and survived.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1217,"startIndex":1203,"value":" three rounds "},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":983,"startIndex":964,"value":".32-caliber handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":69,"startIndex":56,"value":"New York City"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-11","details":{"endIndex":336,"startIndex":309,"value":"Melrose Houses in the Bronx"},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	APDHGWINATRUC

1769	http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160225_Mourners_remember_Chester_man_shot_by_police.html	Mourners remember Chester man shot by police	Mourners remember Chester man shot by policeLast updated: Thursday, February 25, 2016, 1:08 AM Relatives and friends gathered Wednesday to remember Shalamar Longer, the Chester man killed by police in a hail of gunfire on Feb. 8, and to vow to press for change. "The police have started to take our kids' lives," the Rev. Calvin Williams told dozens of mourners as he officiated a funeral service at St. Luke's Community Christian Church in Chester. "It's bad enough that our kids are killing each other, but now, we're just like Florida, Baltimore, we're like New York." Longer, 33, was killed this month after an early-morning police chase that ended when he crashed his SUV in a Chester neighborhood. Longer, who had vowed to his passenger that he would not return to prison, then allegedly pointed a loaded gun at police, and officers opened fire. Police fired nearly 100 shots. Longer never fired his weapon. Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan ruled the shooting justified because he said officers had reason to believe Longer might kill them. At Wednesday's service, Longer's family and friends again called for a more thorough investigation into his death. After the service, Shawn Tucker, Longer's father, remained resolute in saying that nearly 100 shots fired at one man is excessive. Tucker also questioned whether Longer was targeted by police that night, and called for an explanation as to why the police chase merited response from at least six officers. Whelan said last week that he does not believe officers knew Longer was driving the car when an officer attempted to pull him over. A spokeswoman for his office said Wednesday that Whelan reached out to Williams, the pastor, this week to discuss concerns among members of the community. Friends and family throughout the service acknowledged that Longer had his share of problems. He had been in and out of jail, on probation and parole, and had run-ins with police, according to Tucker. But he was also a good father to three young kids, his friends said. Someone you could talk to after weeks or years has passed, and "it was like you never missed a day," said his cousin Asmyra Trusty.

Two 15-year-old girls were shot once at Independence High School, but it was not clear what led up to their deaths, Glendale Officer Tracey Breeden told reporters. Authorities were not looking for anyone else, and a gun was found near the bodies, she said. The circumstances suggested the possibility of a murder-suicide or double-suicide, but Breeden said no determination had been made. She had no information on the relationship between the girls, who died at the scene and were found near an administration building. Police arrived within two minutes of being called, and the school of more than 2,000 students went on lockdown, Breeden said. Hundreds of worried parents soon began arriving at nearby discount and convenience stores. Breeden told parents awaiting word on their kids that "your children are safe." Cheryl Rice said she went to a store after a friend called about the shooting and asked after Rice's 15-year-old daughter. But the girl called as Rice arrived at the store. "She said, 'I'm OK,' so I of course started crying," Rice said. She said it was horrible waiting for word about her child. "You don't know if it's your daughter or not. You don't know who's being bullied. You don't know who is being picked on. You don't know anything. It could be anybody," Rice said. School district officials said parents will be bused to the school to be reunited with their children. Other students who got permission from their parents left campus on their own. Glendale Union High School District alerted parents to the shooting through emails and automatic phone calls and released information on social media, Superintendent Brian Capistran said. Students typically are not allowed to use their cellphones during lockdowns, but as calls from parents flooded the district, officials asked teachers to have students call family, Capistran said. Social workers and counselors will be available to students and staff when school resumes Tuesday, the superintendent said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":538,"startIndex":533,"value":"a gun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":8,"startIndex":0,"value":"Glendale"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":77,"startIndex":53,"value":"Independence High School"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3C740IG3ELF7T

Police found two 15-year-old female sophomores lying next to each other on campus, each dead of a single gunshot wound, according to ABC15. Officials said that evidence found on scene lead them to believe that one of the girls took the life of the other girl before taking her own life. She had no information on the relationship between the girls, who died at the scene and were found near an administration building. The spokesperson said investigators believe this to be an "isolated incident" and wanted to reassure parents that "your children are safe". "I never imagined something like this would happen at my school", Arianna said. Lanie Walter, who is a senior at the school, heard ambulances on her way to campus but didn't think much of it until her first class was locked down. Buses picked up parents from the Walmart and took them to the school to meet and pick up their children. Local media reported that one person had died in the incident, at Independence High School, which was on lockdown, according to police and school officials. The school asked parents to avoid the campus and to pick up their children at a nearby Wal-Mart in Glendale, a city of about 200,000 people just northwest of Phoenix. Although the school hasn't released any details, many students have been in touch with their parents through cell phones. "It could be anybody", she said. As she waited to be reunited with her son, Kramer said she anxious about whether any of his friends were harmed. She didn't discuss the conditions of the teens. Independence High, which is just a couple miles outside Phoenix, has about 2,000 students, school district representative Sara Clawson said. After the discovery the school was on lockdown. Some nearby schools in the Glendale Elementary School District also went into lockdown as a "precautionary measure". Streets are closed to traffic in the residential area around the campus.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":56,"startIndex":48,"value":"Glendale"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":1163,"startIndex":1139,"value":"Independence High School"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":87,"startIndex":85,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":198,"startIndex":196,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":87,"startIndex":85,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AVKU3G6QJAYFE
1803	http://abc11.com/news/widow-of-charleston-shooting-victim-speaks-at-duke/1193020/	Widow of Charleston church shooting victim speaks at Duke | abc11.com	Widow of Charleston church shooting victim speaks at Duke | abc11.comThe widow of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was shot and killed at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, spoke ahead of a forum on faith and race at Duke University on Tuesday. Jennifer Pinckney said she continues to struggle with the loss of her husband and thinks about him daily. Pinckney's husband was the minister of Emanuel AME where he and eight parishioners were gunned down last June during a Bible study. She tries to keep her daughters busy and active with their regular routines before the shooting. Pinckney said the hardest part is not seeing her husband each Sunday in the pulpit. It's in those times, she says she and her daughters lean on their faith most. "Even though this violent act happened, we all have to put God first," Pinckney said. A white man, Dylann Roof, is charged with murder in state court and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty at his trial set to begin in July. Roof also faces dozens of charges, including hate crimes, in federal court. Federal prosecutors have not yet said whether they will seek the death penalty. A hearing in that case is set for Thursday in Charleston. She said Tuesday that she has not reached out to Roof and has no desire to. She will not attend the trial on a regular basis, but has a circle of friends who will go on her behalf. She wants her legacy to be a champion for gun control, education and healthcare. Through the Pinckney Foundation she wants to purchase a full-service mobile health unit to serve rural areas in and around Charleston. That was a goal of her husband's. "I still believe that one day I'm going to see Clementa," Pinckney said. "I know that he is looking down on me and the girls. He is smiling down on us."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":1198,"startIndex":1188,"value":"Charleston"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":154,"startIndex":135,"value":" Emanuel AME Church"},"state":"SC - South Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":864,"startIndex":853,"value":" Dylann Roo"},"race":{"endIndex":852,"startIndex":843,"value":"white man"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":108,"startIndex":86,"value":"Rev.

Aaren O'Connor, 25, moved from California to Chicago just over a year ago for a new job and to be with her boyfriend. "I pleaded with her when she told me she was going to go to Chicago. I said there are much safer places for you to be," Aaren's father, David O'Connor, told ABC owned station WLS. Aaren was hit by a stray bullet as she was sitting in her car after work, police confirmed to ABC News. According to David O'Connor, Aaren was on the phone with her sister when the shooting happened. He tried calling his daughter back when the line cut out. "She was incoherent, didn't know where she was, and kept saying that her head hurts. Her head hurts," he told WLS. "I wish I could have known what was going on, so I could have told her that I love her one more time." A spokesperson for John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County confirmed O'Connor's death to ABC News on Tuesday. O'Connor's shooting comes as the murder rate in Chicago is markedly higher than this time last year. According to a Chicago police spokesperson, there have been 70 murders in the city so far this year. By contrast, there had only been 35 murders during that same time period in 2015, meaning the number of homicides has doubled so far this year.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":28,"startIndex":16,"value":"Stray Bullet"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":172,"startIndex":164,"value":"Chicago "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":279,"startIndex":269,"value":"Windy City"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":549,"startIndex":535,"value":"David O'Connor"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":299,"startIndex":297,"value":"25"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":295,"startIndex":281,"value":"Aaren O'Connor"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Although an Uber sticker was attached to the windshield, it was not known if the victim was on duty at the time of the shooting - or if the victim was even an Uber driver at all. Detectives say the shooter or shooters pulled alongside the victim's car and opened fire, shooting off approximately eight rounds before fleeing around 2:20 a.m. Officers who happened to be in the area heard the gunshots and saw an SUV fleeing the scene. Los Angeles police started the pursuit before the California Highway Patrol took over once the vehicle hit the freeway. CHP pursued the car on the 10 Freeway and various surface streets. The SUV eventually pulled over at Hacienda Boulevard near the 60 Freeway in La Puente, where CHP arrested four suspects without further incident. Investigators said the suspects, two men and two women, are believed to have gang ties. It was not known if the victim was a gang member. Police searched the victim's car and the suspects' SUV and found no weapons in either.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":542,"startIndex":537,"value":"eight"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":686,"startIndex":675,"value":"Los Angeles"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":581,"startIndex":572,"value":"2:20 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":239,"startIndex":186,"value":"the intersection of North Broadway and Griffin Avenue"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1VEXF7BDDZIMI
1822	http://accesswdun.com/article/2015/10/343341/update-two-hall-co-deputies-injured-in-fridays-winder-standoff	UPDATE: Two Hall Co. deputies injured in Friday's Winde... | AccessWDUN.com	UPDATE: Two Hall Co. deputies injured in Friday's Winde... | AccessWDUN.comWINDER - Despite initial reports that only one Hall County deputy was shot during a Barrow County standoff Friday afternoon, The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) now says that two deputies were injured during the incident. According to an updated media release from Nelly Miles with the GBI's Office of Public Affairs, the deputies were struck by gunfire from 45-year-old Jason Foreman of Lula. The shooting occurred at a Melinda Drive residence in Winder as they were attempting to serve Foreman with an arrest warrant for a Hall County murder that took place the day before. Neither deputies' injuries were thought to be life-threatening. Miles said one of the deputies immediately returned fire, and it is currently believed that Foreman was struck as he retreated from his initial position into an "enclosed garage structure." Earlier reports stated that the suspect barricaded himself inside the home following the exchange of gunfire. A GBI robot would locate the suspect's deceased body inside the structure following a short window of negotiation efforts. At this time, none of the deputies involved in the case have been identified. Foreman's body was transported to the GBI Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy and further examination; that process is expected to take place Monday. An earlier version of the story containing more information on the case has been included below: UNDATED - The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is now handling the case involving a standoff in Barrow County that began with Hall County deputies trying to serve warrants on a murder suspect Friday afternoon. Hall County Sheriff's Deputy Nicole Bailes said deputies were looking for 45-year-old Jason Foreman at a home on Melinda Drive when it all started around 3:00 p.m. Friday. "They were met with gunfire from our suspect. Officers did return fire and subsequently did strike Mr. Foreman," Bailes told CBS 46. In a news release, Bailes said deputies retreated and called in Barrow and Hall County SWAT teams. Foreman had barricaded himself inside the home after the exchange of gunfire. "After a period of time negotiating, a GBI robot was able to verify that Foreman was deceased," Bailes wrote. During the gunfire, one of the Hall County deputies was hit. In social media posts Friday afternoon, the Barrow County Sheriff's Office indicated the deputy's gunshot wound was not life threatening. Bailes said one of the Hall deputies who initially responded has been placed on administrative leave, pending the investigation. So far, authorities have not released the names of the deputies involved in the Friday incident. Nelly Miles with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Office of Public Affairs said the agency was working on an updated statement Saturday morning. A few details are also beginning to emerge in the murder Foreman was a suspect in. It happened in the Lula area of Hall County late Thursday afternoon. Deputies responded to a shots fired call at 4181 Cagle Road around 5:53 p.m., according to Hall County Sheriff's Deputy Nicole Bailes. "We do have a victim that is deceased, (a) 32-year-old male that was deceased from stab wound there," Bailes told CBS 46. Bailes Saturday morning identified the victim as Jessie Weber of Lula. Weber was taken to Northeast Georgia Medical Center where he underwent surgery. He died later Thursday evening, according to Bailes. Bailes said investigators don't believe the incident was a random crime. She said Foreman and Weber were what she described as acquaintances of one another. Weber's body was taken to the Dekalb County Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":535,"startIndex":529,"value":"Winder"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1846,"startIndex":1837,"value":"3:00 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-11","details":{"endIndex":525,"startIndex":500,"value":"a Melinda Drive residence"},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":198,"startIndex":189,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":442,"startIndex":440,"value":"45"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":465,"startIndex":452,"value":"Jason Foreman"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":442,"startIndex":440,"value":"45"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":465,"startIndex":452,"value":"Jason Foreman"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A18ZUFGMNOVI2Y

At 5:45 p.m., A report of gunfire brought Canyon police, West Texas A&M police, Randall County sheriff’s deputies and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers to a house in the 2400 block of 10th Avenue. Officers set up perimeters around the house and saw Michael David Keith, 36, of Canyon, emerge from the home. Police deployed Tasers on the man and brought him into custody. “He was extremely disorderly and was trying to gain entry back into the house at the time,” Canyon Police Chief Dale Davis said. “We were able to subdue him with the use of a Taser.” Keith was taken to Northwest Texas Hospital for an evaluation and was later booked into Randall County jail on a charge of deadly conduct by discharging a firearm, a third-degree felony. If convicted, Keith faces two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Officers later discovered a neighbor’s vehicle nearby had been damaged by a bullet in the incident. “We were just glad that we were able to resolve the situation without the individual getting hurt or one of the officers getting hurt,” Davis said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":100,"startIndex":94,"value":"Canyon"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":164,"startIndex":156,"value":"5:45 p.m"},"date":"2016-03-08","details":{"endIndex":151,"startIndex":140,"value":"10th Avenue"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":434,"startIndex":431,"value":" 36"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":430,"startIndex":411,"value":"Michael David Keith"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":434,"startIndex":431,"value":" 36"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":430,"startIndex":411,"value":"Michael David Keith"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

"This is not right... it's not right the way the baby was shot," said Myrtle. According to police, Calin sped away after an officer tried to stop him. He then exited his still-running vehicle on foot. "They said the police told him to show his hands," said Myrtle. "But he didn't... that's what he hear but we don't believe it's true." The officer said he shot Calin because he feared for his life, and thought Calin was reaching for a gun. Calin later died at a local hospital. No weapon was found at the scene. Still, community leaders urged that family and friends of Calin's be patient. A local bishop, Hubert Owens, led the gathering today. "Let the authorities do their jobs before we overstep our bounds," he said. The incident is being investigated by the Texas Rangers and the DA's office. The FBI is also being kept in the loop, and the DPS Trooper has been placed on leave.

(AP) — A shooting after a Mardi Gras parade in Pass Christian killed two men and wounded four other people Sunday, south Mississippi authorities said. Carlos Bates, 29, of Gulfport, and Isiah Major III, 43, of Bay St. Louis both died at the scene, Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove told local news media. The victims' hometowns are near Pass Christian on Mississippi's Gulf Coast. Four other people were hospitalized, Pass Christian Police Chief Tim Hendricks told the Sun Herald (http://bit.ly/20PHjO1) and WLOX-TV (http://bit.ly/1nRDMjF). Police received a call about a fight shortly after the last parade unit completed the route, and officers learned shots had been fired, Hendricks told the newspaper. The shooting occurred about two blocks north of the parade route in Pass Christian (kris-TYANH), a coastal city of 5,300 about 45 miles from New Orleans. About 50,000 people had attended the St. Paul Carnival Association's parade, Hendricks added. Celeste Plaisance told the newspaper, "I think I heard 12 shots fired. We thought it was fireworks at first." She added that when she saw someone had been shot and people were running away, she ran into her mother's house. The bodies, covered in yellow sheets, were near her mother's steps. Police drove through the yard to avoid disturbing police crime scene tape set up to keep bystanders away, she said. Later Sunday, shots rang out along the Bacchus parade route in New Orleans, although no one was injured, police said. Officers found a handgun in the area and were searching for a suspect or suspects. The shootings occurred a day after parade accidents in south Louisiana injured a man and a woman. Police in Lafayette, Louisiana, told local media that a man fell from the top level of a float during a Mardi Gras parade there. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, EMS spokesman Mike Chustz told The Advocate (http://bit.ly/1QkmxhS) that a float also hit a pedestrian during the Spanish Town parade. Cpl. L'Jean McKneely, a Baton Rouge police spokesman, said in an email Sunday to The Associated Press that he knew only that the woman was taken to a hospital with moderate injuries.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1125,"startIndex":1111,"value":"12 shots fired"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-06","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":265,"startIndex":262,"value":"29,"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":260,"startIndex":248,"value":"Carlos Bates"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":302,"startIndex":300,"value":"43"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":298,"startIndex":283,"value":"Isiah Major III"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]}]}	A1KZ0KE93WNN5O

At 11:15 p.m., police were dispatched to the 1400 block of South Polk Street on a report of a stolen vehicle and a firearms offense. Police learned that a security officer responded to an alarm at the building and was checking the church when a man ran out one of the doors, police said Monday. The man hopped into the security guard’s running vehicle and drove away. The vehicle stopped on a curb in the 100 block of Southwest 15th Avenue. The guard chased the man and tried to detain him where the vehicle stopped, police said, but the men struggled and the burglar assaulted the guard. The suspect was able to remove the guard’s handgun from its holster and two shots were fired during the scuffle, police said. The burglar then fled, leaving behind a pry bar and a black nylon bag. The guard, police said, was not injured and police recovered cologne, a blood pressure monitor and a small scale that may been stolen before the church burglary. During their investigation, police determined the man broke in through a window on the church’s northeast side and burglarized a coin-operated machine. Police describe the burglar as a white man, 25, 6 feet tall, about 180 pounds, wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and brown shorts. The man was wearing a black “beanie” hat during the incident and was last seen running west on Southwest 15th Avenue. During the investigation, a security guard found a gray hooded Dallas Cowboys sweatshirt hanging from a fence at Southwest 15th Avenue and South Harrison Street that police think may be linked to the burglar. If you have information about the suspect or the items recovered at the scene, contact the Amarillo Police Department or Amarillo Crime Stoppers at 806-374-4400.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":948,"startIndex":945,"value":"two"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":923,"startIndex":916,"value":"handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":64,"startIndex":56,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":292,"startIndex":287,"value":"11:15"},"date":"2016-03-11","details":{"endIndex":360,"startIndex":329,"value":"1400 block of South Polk Street"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":299,"startIndex":287,"value":"11:15 p.m., "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Yes","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1430,"startIndex":1428,"value":"25"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1422,"startIndex":1417,"value":"white"}}],"victim-section":[]}	AYJGJAIY0EXW

The four attacks took place in Kalamazoo County, in southwest Michigan, and a a "strong suspect" is in custody, according to cops. One of those killed was a 14-year-old girl, who died after being shot at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. She was gravely injured and then revived at hospital, before finally succumbing to her wounds, reports Fox News reporter Chris Koops. Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family tonight.” When asked by a reporter on the scene about what the gunman’s motive might be, he said: “I don't think there is a why. It’s absolutely ridiculous.” Read more: San Bernardino killer's Apple iPhone password changed while in the FBI's hands "We seem to be dealing with a worst-case scenario, someone driving around shooting," Mr Matyas told NBC News earlier. At least three people were wounded in the attacks. Matyas also told a Fox News affiliate: "The threat to the public is over. We now have our suspect". The suspect was not identified, but media reports, citing police, said he was aged 45, from Kalamazoo. The public safety department earlier described the gunman as a white male in his 50s who was believed to be driving a dark colored Chevy HHR SUV with chrome wheels, adding that the vehicle may have been damaged. According to local media, four people were shot dead at the Cracker Barrel restaurant in Texas Township, and two more died at a Seelye Kia dealership in Kalamazoo. The carnage began early Saturday evening when Matyas said police were first called to a Kalamazoo County apartment building where a woman was shot multiple times before later being listed in serious condition. Hours later, they were called to the car dealership where two people were shot and killed, and a third was wounded. Four people were killed at a third shooting scene in the Cracker Barrel parking lot, where the gunman opened fire on people in their cars after a brief conversation. The victims and shooting scenes appeared to have no link apart from the suspect. No motive for the seemingly random shootings had been determined.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":1710,"startIndex":1701,"value":"Kalamazoo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-19","details":{"endIndex":486,"startIndex":460,"value":"Cracker Barrel restaurant."},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":209,"startIndex":204,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1420,"startIndex":1417,"value":"50s"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1405,"oldEnd":1404,"oldStart":1398,"startIndex":1399,"value":"white "}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":414,"startIndex":411,"value":"14-"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":1850,"startIndex":1843,"value":" woman "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1L8ZQ4A13OGWX

Kenneth Mann, authorities said in a news release. Officials said he has been placed on paid administrative leave. Mann, a 20-year veteran of the Mena Police Department, shot and killed 30-year-old Shawn Dickens about noon Feb. 16 while responding to a call to Kess' Korner of a man in possession of methamphetamine and a loaded revolver. The convenience store is at South Reine Street and Reeves Avenue in Mena. At the scene, Dickens resisted as police began to perform a pat-down search and fought as Mann attempted to place him into custody, according to the news release. Mann and Dickens engaged in a physical fight that included Dickens being thrown to the ground, authorities said. Dickens later fled on foot, which caused a revolver to fall from his waistband and land on the ground, according to police. He was shot by Mann after he turned to pick up the handgun and ignored commands to stop and move away from the weapon, officers said. First aid was administered to Dickens at the scene before he was transported to Mena Regional Health System. Dickens was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Police said Polk County Coroner Brian Bowser found a "large amount of suspected methamphetamine" while retrieving Dickens' belongings at the hospital. Dickens was on parole for a 2011 conviction for manufacturing and delivering a controlled substance, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette previously reported. He was sentenced to 7½ years in prison but was released on parole in May, Arkansas Community Corrections spokesman Dina Taylor told the newspaper. Two investigations are ongoing: an internal investigation at the Mena Police Department regarding whether the officer followed department policy and an Arkansas State Police investigation into the shooting.

Erick Bohannon said. Authorities identified the deceased as David and Kendal Gisch, both 22. The two died from what appeared to be gunshot wounds to the upper body, Bohannon said in a news release. Bohannon would not say whether the incident was being investigated as a homicide, but said no arrests have been made in connection with the deaths. “At this particular moment in time, I don’t see any need for a full-scale search for a suspect,” Bohannon said. Their bodies were found inside the offices of GischMedia after police were called to the building at 10:43 a.m. Amarillo police and the Special Crimes Unit roped off the office at 5000 S.W. 45th Ave. and were investigating the deaths Monday afternoon. Allstate Insurance agent Clark Damon owns the office building and said he rents office space to GischMedia. Damon said David Gisch was the owner of the company and said Kendal Gisch was his wife. Potter County marriage records show the two were married earlier this year. Damon, whose insurance agency occupies most of the building, said two GischMedia employees discovered the bodies about 10:30 a.m. and then alerted him and the police. “It looks like he shot her and then he shot himself,” Damon said. Damon said he was in his office for a couple of hours prior to the discovery, but did not hear or see anything unusual. According to the company website, GischMedia is a search engine optimization and web design company. Damon said the business had been at the location for about a year and a half and said the company had four employees. Randall County Justice of the Peace Clay Houdashell ordered autopsies. Julia Greif, 25, said she was friends with the Gisches and said she had gone to school with them at West Texas A&M University. “I think it’s shocking to everyone and it’s almost unbelievable that something like this could happen,” she said. Alec Gardner, 22, also said he went to school with the couple at WT. Gardner said he worked with them at GischMedia for about seven months after he was hired as their first employee in 2014. “They were two people that believed in me, really, before anybody else did,” he said. He said nothing seemed out of the ordinary when he last spoke to David Gisch about a month and a half ago. “David and Kendal were always really very self-motivated, very dedicated people,” he said. “I thought they would go really far in the world. “We’ve all lost a lot, whether you knew them or not, just because of what they could’ve done.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":171,"startIndex":163,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1320,"startIndex":1310,"value":"10:30 a.m."},"date":"2016-03-07","details":{"endIndex":865,"startIndex":852,"value":"S.W. 45th Ave"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":119,"startIndex":112,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":300,"startIndex":298,"value":"22"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1049,"startIndex":1038,"value":"David Gisch"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":300,"startIndex":298,"value":"22"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":291,"startIndex":279,"value":"Kendal Gisch"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

That gun turned out to shoot only BBs, or airsoft pellets, according to a police spokesperson. Sgt. Dorcy McGinnis says the officer "in fear of the life" of employees and customers shot the suspect. Police have now identified him as Christopher Fillmore, 36. He was shot in the shoulder, according to investigators, and will survive. Jenetta Welch's car was hit by errant police gunfire. She was inside the store at the time, working. "Just wrong place, wrong time. It's pretty big. It's Montgomery. It's pretty crazy," she said. This all started at about 11:30am Monday inside the Walmart off Highway 105 near Walden Road in Conroe. A loss prevention officer saw someone apparently trying to steal merchandise. Employees called police before that person ever got outside. When the loss prevention officer approached, the person pulled what police say their officer perceived as a real weapon. The officer was just arriving and saw it. Conroe police say that officer feared for the life of the loss prevention officer and others here, and opened fire. "It's scary when it happens anywhere. Everybody inside is on edge," said customer Kristan Leming. Customers and employees, though shaken some, seem thankful for the quick response by police. It's not clear yet if surveillance cameras outside the story will show the violent confrontation. Fillmore has now been charged with aggravated robbery. He was treated and released from the hospital and is now in police custody.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":94,"startIndex":88,"value":"Conroe"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":780,"oldEnd":779,"oldStart":771,"startIndex":772,"value":"11:30am "},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":848,"startIndex":794,"value":"the Walmart off Highway 105 near Walden Road in Conroe"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":347,"startIndex":336,"value":"the officer"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":474,"startIndex":471,"value":"36."},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":469,"startIndex":449,"value":"Christopher Fillmore"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AP1CRKA54S84U

Many of those who turned out say they're also calling for more information about the deadly officer-involved shooting last weekend. Authorities say a Texas trooper shot and killed 24-year old Calin Roquemore of Tatum, Tx., after a routine traffic stop turned into a brief foot chase in Beckville, Texas Saturday night. The trooper told investigators he thought the suspect was reaching for a gun and he shot Roquemore in self-defense. But no weapon was found at the scene. Myrtle Roquemore, Calin's aunt expressed frustration at the protest about knowing so little about the investigation. "We don't know the detail(s). We don't know nothing. And that's what we want. We want justice. We want to know what's going on," explained Roquemore. Relatives and crowd members say they did hear that the Texas Rangers have been brought in to investigate, and Texas DPS says they also contacted the FBI to monitor the case, as well. Funeral arrangements for Calin Roquemore are set for 1:00 p.m. on Saturday at Galilee Baptist Church in Hallsville, Texas.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":498,"startIndex":489,"value":"Beckville"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":486,"startIndex":434,"value":"routine traffic stop turned into a brief foot chase "},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":520,"startIndex":515,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":385,"startIndex":383,"value":"24"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":410,"startIndex":395,"value":"Calin Roquemore"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1L5ICUFG3P03K

Although an Uber placard was found on the windshield, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told the police commission that there is no Uber involvement in the shooting. Detectives say the shooter or shooters pulled alongside the victim's car and opened fire, shooting off approximately eight rounds before fleeing around 2:20 a.m. Officers who happened to be in the area heard the gunshots and saw an SUV fleeing the scene. Los Angeles police started the pursuit, but the California Highway Patrol took over once the vehicle hit the freeway. CHP pursued the car on the 10 Freeway and various surface streets.

2004	http://abc11.com/news/victim-of-flare-gun-attack-at-panera-describes-incident/1193202/	Victim of flare-gun attack at Panera describes incident | abc11.com	Victim of flare-gun attack at Panera describes incident | abc11.comPolice in Durham are still investigating after a man was shot in the face with a flare gun earlier Tuesday at a shopping center in the 600 block of Witherspoon Boulevard off Hwy 15-501. Detectives said two men got into an argument in the restroom of a Panera restaurant, and that's when the shooting happened. The victim was taken to the hospital with serious injuries. Late Tuesday evening, ABC11 spoke to the victim, Kenneth Bartlett, who arrived at UNC's Burn Center in a lot of pain. He was attacked with a flare gun that was fired directly on his face. The man who pulled the trigger was no stranger, Bartlett said. Bartlett is now the walking wounded. But it could have been worse. His morning routine at this Durham Panera bread was interrupted by a bizarre encounter with a flare-gun-wielding man inside the store's men's restroom. "Next thing I know is this guy is just walked up behind me and puts the gun, the flare gun right into my cheek, and pulls the trigger," Bartlett said. He described seeing smoke and the flame from the flare as it burned through his face. He said there was now a hole in the side of his face and he didn't know at the time whether he was going to live or not. Bartlett also disputed what Durham police said -- that an argument started the incident. "Oh no, we didn't say a word to each other," Bartlett said. "I didn't even know who it was." While wrestling the flare gun from his attacker's hand, Bartlett says he realized he knew the gunman -- a local, homeless man -- he says he's offered help to in the past. "At first I didn't know who it was. I didn't know until after I'd been shot and then he didn't expect me to turn around," Bartlett said. "His eyes got kinda big." Employees at nearby stores and Panera customers say the news of the shooting was confusing and frightening. "You know you would expect it to be relatively calm around this time," said Andrian Tucker, an employee at a nearby Learning Express. "You know we have a lot of home-school traffic around our areas around the morning." Tucker said he was working across the street when he saw EMS and police cruisers surrounding the restaurant. He said he was shocked when he learned what happened. "We come here for lunch like twice a week," said Panera customer Adela Mann. "So to hear that is very alarming and kind of scary." Police were seen taking a man into custody and were interviewing witnesses. Forensics teams were on the scene sweeping for prints. Bartlett said he has no idea why he was attacked, other than to suggest perhaps his assailant was mentally unstable. While he recovers, Durham police are still investigating, and as of yet, no arrests have been made.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":858,"startIndex":848,"value":" flare-gun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":84,"startIndex":76,"value":" Durham "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":251,"startIndex":215,"value":"Witherspoon Boulevard off Hwy 15-501"},"state":"NC - North Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":166,"startIndex":158,"value":"earlier "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":502,"startIndex":485,"value":" Kenneth Bartlett"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N
2010	http://www.kmbc.com/news/mass-shooting-reported-at-central-kansas-workplace/38198462	Sheriff: 4 dead, 14 injured in Kansas shootings | Local News - KMBC Home	Sheriff: 4 dead, 14 injured in Kansas shootings | Local News - KMBC HomeOfficials said four people are dead, including the gunman, and 14 people are injured, 10 critically, after a series of attacks in south-central Kansas. Sheriff T. Walton said at a news conference Thursday evening there are "a number of crime scenes involved," including the Excel Industries plant in Hesston, north of Wichita, where 15 people were shot. The suspect was fatally shot by authorities during an exchange of gunfire. VIDEO: Watch Sheriff T. Walton's Thursday night update The sheriff said a shooting also took place in the plant parking lot and two other locations nearby.?? KMBC has confirmed with law enforcement authorities that the suspect is Cedric Ford, a 38-year-old employee of the Excel plant. Images on his Facebook page showed him posing with and shooting guns. Police said officers have surrounded Ford's home in Newton, Kansas. They believe Ford's roommate may be inside. Loud music was heard blaring from the home but no one answered the door. A hospital in Newton was on lockdown Thursday evening, something a spokeswoman said was done as a precaution because of all the police activity in the area. Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm. Espinoza told The Associated Press the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the shooter got a different gun and Martin took off running. "I looked right at him and he looked right at me," Espinoza said. Hesston is a community of about 3,700 residents about 35 miles north of Wichita. Excel Industries was awarded the Governor's Exporter of the Year award in 2013 from the Kansas Department of Commerce. The company manufactures Hustler and Big Dog mowing equipment and was founded in Hesston in 1960. ???We???re really saddened by this horrific event and our heart goes out to all of our employees, all the families whose loved ones got injured or killed, and we???re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,??? said Excel president and CEO Paul Mullet. Gov. Sam Brownback ordered flags across Kansas lowered to half staff Friday in memory of the victims. "I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today's shooting in Hesston," he said. "This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts. State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come." BREAKING DETAILS. ELI: FIRST ON THE SCENE HERE, DESPITE NOT HAVING ANY BACKUP, RAN INTO THE BUILDING HERE, AND SHOT THE SUSPECT, ALL WHILE BEING SHOT AT BY THIS MAN. 10:00. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AFTER ALL OF INJURED, THERE IS AN. QUIET -- AN QUIET. THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL AREA. THE POPULATION HERE IS 3700 AND WORKS HERE. AN EMOTIONAL SCENE IS PLAYING OUT HERE.

ELI: A FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEE TELLS ME TONIGHT HE WAS 38 YEARS OLD AND WORKED AT EXCEL. WE FOUND THESE PICTURES ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.

Bailes said Sergio Salamanca, 17, was in the back seat of the vehicle playing with a handgun. Salamanca discharged one round, which hit the front seat passenger in the back. Bailes said the teens tried to take their injured friend to the Quick Care off Shallowford Road in Oakwood, but found the business was closed when they arrived. At that point, according to Bailes, the teens flagged down an Oakwood police officer for help, and Salamanca ran from the scene. The shooting victim was taken to Northeast Georgia Medical Center where she underwent emergency surgery for her injuries. As of Saturday morning, there was no word on her condition. Bailes said investigators learned Salamanca was wanted by the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) for escape. Deputies tried tracking the suspect with K9 officers, but could not find him. Later in the evening, patrol deputies found Salamanca and arrested him. At last report, Salamanca remained in the Hall County Jail, charged with reckless conduct. Bailes said other charges are possible.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":350,"startIndex":347,"value":"one"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":138,"startIndex":131,"value":"Oakwood"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":761,"startIndex":729,"value":"Northeast Georgia Medical Center"},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":123,"startIndex":118,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":264,"startIndex":262,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":260,"startIndex":244,"value":"Sergio Salamanca"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2OUANFKZAFZF2

A Killeen Police Department SWAT team member, Hornsby was killed in a shootout with a man armed with an assault rifle at an apartment complex. “Early (Sunday) morning, this community experienced the loss of one of Killeen’s finest. The days ahead will be challenging, but for now, we are mourning the loss of a great officer,” Chief Dennis Baldwin said in a statement. “Our hearts and prayers go out to the officer’s family during this difficult time.” KPD officers responded to a disturbance call just before midnight Saturday at Grandon Manor Apartments in Killeen, The Killeen Daily Herald reported. The person who dialed 911 reported a white man came out of his apartment carrying the rifle and threatening people by the pool. According to one witness, the shooter asked neighbors if they were “ready to go to heaven.” SWAT was called once responding officers saw the rifle. The man returned to his apartment and began “shooting at the officers,” according to a KPD news release. Two officers were shot, and Hornsby was pronounced dead at 1:27 a.m. Sunday. The other officer was listed in stable condition following surgery in a hospital in Temple. The shooter was shot and killed by police during the shootout. His identity was withheld by police pending notification of kin. According to the Daily Herald, the suspect’s neighbors said the shooter had been drinking since 7 p.m. and had offered them tequila. Neighbors had also described him as a soldier who had just returned from Afghanistan. According to Plainview friends, Hornsby attended Plainview Independent School District from first through fifth grades and in the seventh grade before moving off to Temple. Hornsby’s father, Charles, operated the Golden Corral restaurant at Fifth and Amarillo streets. Hornsby was married and had two children.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":861,"startIndex":856,"value":"rifle"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":165,"startIndex":157,"value":" Killeen"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-06","details":{"endIndex":308,"startIndex":291,"value":"apartment complex"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":333,"startIndex":325,"value":" morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":813,"startIndex":806,"value":" white "}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":109,"startIndex":86,"value":"Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Hornsby "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":813,"startIndex":806,"value":" white "},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N
2049	http://abc7chicago.com/news/police-seek-surveillance-video-in-heart-of-chicago-deadly-shooting/1194580/	Aaren O'Connor shooting: Police seek public's help after woman killed by stray bullet | abc7chicago.com	Aaren O'Connor shooting: Police seek public's help after woman killed by stray bullet | abc7chicago.comA 25-year-old woman was struck by a stray bullet and killed in the city's Heart of Chicago neighborhood last week. Police are asking for the public's help to find the suspect. Police say they have surveillance video from the scene, and that's provided some positive leads, but they're hoping the public can help connect the dots. Police spoke in personal terms about the death of Aaren O'Connor, who had moved here from California. "I have a young daughter myself, 19 years old. I'm sure she's going to be asking to move somewhere sometime soon, and I think of that," Lt. Ozzie Valdez said. O'Connor was killed Friday evening near Damen and 21st Street in the Heart of Chicago neighborhood, a victim of possible gang crossfire. Police said she was sitting in her car outside her apartment around 6:40 p.m. when a stray bullet hit her in the head. O'Connor was on the phone with relatives when she was shot. "She was incoherent, didn't know where she was, and kept saying that her head hurts," said David O'Connor, her father. "I wish I could have known what was going on, so I could have told her that I love her one more time." Police said they have positive leads and are looking at surveillance video in the area, but detectives appealed for help. "We are strongly encouraging any citizens - any members of the community that have seen something during the incident, seen something after the incident - we're asking them to come forward," Lt. Valdez said. O'Connor moved to Chicago about a year-and-a-half ago to take a job with Oak Brook-based toy company Tomy and to be with a long distance boyfriend. The move had worried her father. "I pleaded with her when she told me she was going to go to Chicago," he said. "I said there are much safer places for you to be." "It really pulls at your heart strings. This is a young lady who moved here to Chicago to follow her dreams and pursue a new job about a year and a half ago," Lt. Valdez said. A reward will soon be offered in this case by Aaren O'Connor's friends and co-workers as well as Crime Stoppers. An announcement is planned for this weekend.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":151,"startIndex":136,"value":" a stray bullet"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":194,"startIndex":186,"value":"Chicago "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":908,"startIndex":899,"value":"6:40 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-10","details":{"endIndex":740,"startIndex":733,"value":" Damen "},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":728,"startIndex":720,"value":" evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":107,"startIndex":104,"value":" 25"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":497,"startIndex":483,"value":"Aaren O'Connor"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AVT70WXOWRHGI

The family, which included a 95-year-old woman and her son and daughter, both in their 60's, noticed a man in his 20's park near their vehicle. The family also said the man got out of his vehicle, and acted suspiciously - pacing and staring at the family. Washington says a verbal altercation occurred between the man and the family. The 95-year-old woman attempted to intervene, and the family said she was shoved by the male several times. "The son then retrieved a firearm and asked the male to refrain from assaulting his mother. The suspicious male then advanced towards the son and was shot in the upper torso." "At this point the incident appears to a self-defense shooting and detectives do not plan to charge the son. However, detectives are still interviewing witnesses at the adjacent business and are surveying video footage."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":225,"startIndex":212,"value":"Lawrenceville"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-11","details":{"endIndex":208,"startIndex":166,"value":"storage facility at 1907 Riverside Parkway"},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":361,"startIndex":357,"value":"60's"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":388,"startIndex":384,"value":"20's"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	AWIY48HJRWOPO

(WHAM) - One person is dead and seven others hurt following a shooting early Sunday morning in Rochester. The incident happened around 2:00 a.m. at The Mexican Village nightclub in the area of Lyell Avenue and State Street. Once on-scene, police found several people who had been shot. One individual, a 29-year-old city resident, died at the scene. Seven others at the scene were taken to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Some time later, an eighth victim was dropped off at a hospital by a private vehicle. The ages of the latter seven individuals range from 21 to 30 years old. The Rochester Police Department says a fight had started inside the club and eventually moved outside. The shots were fired outside of the building. In a statement released from Strong Memorial Hospital, they say two patients are in guarded condition, two patients are in satisfactory condition and two patients have been discharged. Mayor Lovely Warren issued a statement on the incident: "Yet again, someone in Rochester reached for a gun to resolve a conflict. And yet again, another life is lost, innocent people are injured, families are devastated and our entire city is suffering. Yet again, one senseless act makes us ask: Why? Why is it that some people can only use violence to cope with a situation? Why is a gun the tool of choice to settle a dispute that certainly cannot be worth the cost of so much suffering? We know the answers to these questions are buried deep in a myriad of issues we are trying to resolve. But none of those issues - not one - offers an excuse for an action like this. As we strive to make our city better, all of our efforts begin with a love and appreciation for human life and the knowledge that every man, woman and child has a right to reach their full potential. We cannot and will not tolerate this level of depravity and wanton disregard for human life. My heart aches for the friends and families of the victims, and I ask our entire city to join me as we keep them in our thoughts and prayers. To the perpetrator or perpetrators of this crime: Make no mistake. The Rochester Police Department and all of our partners in law enforcement will not rest until you are apprehended and brought to justice. You have forfeited your right to walk free in society. Your arrest will make our streets safer -- and you will be arrested. Anyone who tries to hide you or help you escape justice will also be arrested. You will not find a safe harbor in our city. You ended your own life as you know it when you reached for that gun. Finally, I want to once again offer my deep appreciation for the men and women of the Rochester Police Department for their rapid response to last night's incident, which brought calm to a chaotic crime scene and preserved valuable evidence in those crucial moments. Your dedication to the citizens of Rochester is beyond measure." Police say 40 people were in the area at the time of the incident and are being interviewed. The investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made. Anyone with information is asked to call 911 or Crime Stoppers at 423-9300. Chief Michael Ciminelli stated there is no evidence that the general public is in danger. 13WHAM will provide updates as they become available on 13WHAM.com and on the 13WHAM mobile app.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":213,"startIndex":204,"value":"Rochester"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":252,"startIndex":244,"value":"2:00 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":286,"startIndex":286,"value":""},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":200,"startIndex":193,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":415,"startIndex":413,"value":"29"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":689,"value":"21 to 30"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":689,"value":"21 to 30"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":689,"value":"21 to 30"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":698,"startIndex":689,"value":"21 to 30 "},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":689,"value":"21 to 30"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":689,"value":"21 to 30"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A3SDFAOJW87FGP

Responding officers found an unresponsive man in the SUV. The victim has not been identified, police said, and the case is classified as a coroner’s inquest, pending the outcome of an autopsy, which is scheduled for Wednesday.

About 8 p.m. Tuesday, an unidentified 32-year-old man pulled his gold Ford Focus into the parking lot of the Toot’n Totum at 301 Ross St. He walked in and told store employees he’d been shot, Sgt. Leslie Supina said. While the clerk called police, he collapsed, Supina said. The man had two gunshot wounds, Supina said, and he was taken to Northwest Texas hospital. His condition was unavailable Tuesday night. Supina said she received a call from the hospital stating the victim was taken into surgery around 8:45 p.m. The suspect was taken into custody at about 9 p.m., Sgt. Ephraim Contreras said. Police have not yet recovered the firearm. Contreras said officers stopped a witness, the mother of the victim’s children, at the Toot’n Totum at 1500 S. Ross St. She was able to get the suspect on the phone and officers convinced him to speak to police, Contreras said. The witness told police the suspected shooter and the victim are friends and were at a house in the 1300 block of Southeast Fifth Avenue, Contreras said. The two possibly got into an argument that led to the shooting, Contreras said. He said there are three possible crime scenes — two convenience stores and the house where the shooting occurred.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":86,"startIndex":81,"value":"twice"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":55,"startIndex":47,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":262,"oldEnd":261,"oldStart":254,"startIndex":255,"value":"8 p.m. "},"date":"2016-03-08","details":{"endIndex":1257,"startIndex":1221,"value":"1300 block of Southeast Fifth Avenue"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":289,"startIndex":287,"value":"32"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A38OYO6BYY7F7J

Two other B-CU students were injured in Saturday’s shooting. Justine Cunningham, 20, of New York, also was shot in the head and was listed in critical condition at Halifax Health Medical Center. Jamal Williams, 21, of Palmetto, was in stable condition after being shot in the back. According to police, a fight involving Johnson and Lamont Postell Jr. erupted inside the party, then moved to the parking lot of the country club. Lamont Postell Jr., 23, the suspect in the shootings, turned himself into police Saturday about 5 p.m. Postell, also known as “Cornbread,” was not a B-CU student. Postell is charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. Johnson, 23, from Belle Glade, was a sophomore psychology major with a 3.05 GPA. He was on the Wildcats’ football team for one season in 2014, according to a statement released by B-CU. He played football at Glades Central High School, then spent one year at Alabama State University before joining B-CU’s football team. His passing follows the fatal shootings of Timesha “Lisa” Carswell, 21, and Diona McDonald, 19, B-CU students from Michigan. The young women died on Sept. 17, 2015 after being shot by 27-year-old York Zed Bodden, a convicted felon from Miami during a rental dispute at the Carolina Club Apartments in Daytona Beach. Student Micah Parham was critically injured in that shooting. Bodden, from Miami, was arrested there on Sept. 18 and allegedly hanged himself the next day in his cell at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. On Feb. 23, 2015, Ladell Pleasure, was charged with discharging a firearm on school property in a shooting on campus that injured three students. Daytona Beach police said at the time that Pleasure was one of two shooters who exchanged gunfire that apparently stemmed from a feud involving students and non-students from South Florida. The students, who were considered bystanders during that shooting, sustained non-life threatening injuries. In April of that year, another shooting occurred involving four students. They were shot at a house party near the campus. In its statement about the Feb. 13 tragedy, B-CU announced that grief counseling is available for its students. “At Bethune-Cookman University, our first priority is the safety and wellbeing of our students. Our Critical Incident Care Team is currently providing grief counseling and support services to students who are in need. This is a very unfortunate incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the families, loved ones and fellow classmates of these students.’’ Lynn Thompson, B-CU’s vice president for Intercollegiate Athletics, stated, “The life and well-being of every student is sacred and precious to us and we stand in prayer with the families of each of the victims in this senseless tragedy and pray for comfort, healing and strength for the entire B-CU Community.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":447,"startIndex":434,"value":"Daytona Beach"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":430,"startIndex":389,"value":" at a party at the Indigo Lakes Golf Club"},"state":"FL - Florida","time-day":{"endIndex":379,"startIndex":365,"value":"early Saturday"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":900,"startIndex":898,"value":"23"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":800,"startIndex":781,"value":" Lamont Postell Jr."},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1158,"startIndex":1156,"value":"23"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":325,"startIndex":306,"value":"Don\u2019Kevious Johnson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":532,"startIndex":530,"value":"20"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":528,"startIndex":510,"value":"Justine Cunningham"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":662,"startIndex":660,"value":"21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":658,"startIndex":644,"value":"Jamal Williams"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AI4J8TH0Y11X5

About 5 a.m., officers were dispatched to the 5200 block of Royce Drive in reference to a homeowner holding two burgarly suspects at gunpoint. The homeowner told police he saw two people taking property from a shed in the back of his home. The homeowner grabbed a pistol and confronted them. After being ordered to the ground, police said, one of the alleged burglars aggressively threw down the items he had stolen and violently lunged at the homeowner. The homeowner then shot the burglary suspect. The homeowner continued to hold the pair at gunpoint while police were on the way, but the suspected burglars took off running from the scene. Officers searched the area for both suspects and found the one who had been shot. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit investigators obtained information about the second suspect who got away, police said. He was taken into custody Monday and booked into the Randall County jail on a charge of burglary of a building. Police identified the man as Patrick Ramos, 31.

"He's just one of those guys, the minute you meet him you feel like you've known him for years," said Hilary Reiter. Reiter said the last drink she had was poured by 37-year-old Jose Fernandez at the No Name Saloon Friday night. Fernandez has worked at the bar for about a decade. "He poured me a glass of wine and I remember joking with him, 'How did you even know what I was going to order,'" Reiter recalls. Reiter said that is the kind of bartender Jose is, he knows and loves his customers, and they love him back. "He's got this great smile, and he's a great teddy bear, and he's got cheeks you just want to pinch," Reiter said. She said she remembers getting silly with Jose later in the evening and taking pictures together. "Obviously at the time I didn't understand the significance of those photos, but they are very special to me now," she said. Park City police say Fernandez was at a party, with six other people, at a condo on the 1500 block of Empire Avenue around 5 a.m. Monday. They say a fight broke out, and Fernandez was shot in the forehead. "I'm wracking my brain trying to come up with various scenarios that could have resulted in this, and I can come up with absolutely nothing," Reiter said. A couple of people at the party ran to the nearby 7-Eleven on Park Avenue and told the clerk to call police. When police arrived, they arrested 27-year-old James Henfling of Midvale. He is being charged with attempted murder. Fernandez remains at a Salt Lake Valley hospital in critical condition, while friends hold out hope that he manages to pull through. "Everyone is rallying together and sending our thoughts and prayers to Jose," said Josh Tyquiengco. Tyquiengco worked with Jose for four years at the No Name Saloon. "He was a great mentor, he taught me everything I know about the bar scene," Tyquiengco said. He said Jose is an ambassador for Park City, bringing people together for all the local events. "He knew how to direct people to where the fun is to be had, which is what Park City is all about, it's just unfortunate that something like this had to happen in a town where it's not really heard of," Tyquiengco said. Park City Police said they don't have a motive for the shooting, but they did say alcohol was definitely involved. They also said the victim and suspect know each other but they aren't sure in what capacity.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":106,"startIndex":97,"value":"PARK CITY"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1234,"startIndex":1228,"value":" 5 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-22","details":{"endIndex":1221,"startIndex":1194,"value":"1500 block of Empire Avenue"},"state":"UT - Utah","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Yes","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1613,"startIndex":1611,"value":"27"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1637,"startIndex":1623,"value":"James Henfling"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":416,"startIndex":414,"value":"37"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":440,"startIndex":426,"value":"Jose Fernandez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A2V79UIBL6TH4J

That classmate reportedly got it from his house without his parents' permission, CBS affiliate KPHO reported. KPHO has identified the two girls who died in the shooting as May Kieu and Dorothy Dutiel, both 10th graders at the school. Police tell KPHO one of the girls approached a 15-year-old classmate on Thursday, telling him she needed a gun for protection. She promised to return the gun on Friday. The classmate provided her with a family-owned handgun, from his home, without the permission or knowledge of his parents. Police tell KPHO that classmate has spoken to detectives and was cooperative. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office will review his involvement in the matter. Police have not officially released the names of May and Dorothy, but several friends have identified them on social media and to KPHO reporters at the school. They were found next to each other, and the weapon was found beside them, according to Glendale Police Officer Tracey Breeden. Both 15-year-old girls suffered a single gunshot wound, Breeden said. Investigators recovered a weapon and a suicide note, but police did not release the contents of the note. "Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appeared to also be in a relationship," Breeden said. Officers located the students down near the cafeteria area under a covered patio on the southeast portion of campus. Police say nobody witnessed the shooting, but the incident initially caused widespread panic among parents who could not reach their children, and the school was put on lockdown. Hundreds of worried parents crowded the parking lots of nearby discount and convenience stores awaiting information about their children. The lockdown was lifted after several hours. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Courtney-Dean was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the head in a home in southwest Post, Garza County Sheriff Terry Morgan said. The girl’s mother, 34-year-old Ashlee Anne Dean, is being held at the Garza County jail on a capital murder charge, Morgan said. No bond has been set for her yet, according to jail records. The shooting happened about 5:30 p.m. at a residence in the 400 block of South Avenue H, Morgan said. The girl’s father was at work, and no one else was at home. Morgan said Dean has a history of drug use and confessed to shooting her child. “She told us she had just used,” he said. Child Protective Services returned the child to Dean in October, he said. DPS Sgt. Bryan Witt said Texas Rangers were called in Thursday evening to assist with the investigation. “I’m a small department and I don’t have the equipment that I need to conduct the investigation as I’d like to,” Morgan said. “We called in the Rangers to make sure everything is done as perfectly as you can make it.” Witt said the Rangers will offer unique skills and tools in the investigation.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":316,"value":"Post"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":589,"startIndex":580,"value":"5:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-10","details":{"endIndex":639,"startIndex":612,"value":"400 block of South Avenue H"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":189,"startIndex":182,"value":"evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":383,"startIndex":381,"value":"34"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":409,"startIndex":393,"value":"Ashlee Anne Dean"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":205,"startIndex":204,"value":"2"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":234,"startIndex":221,"value":"Courtney-Dean"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AVKU3G6QJAYFE

An officer with the Clarksdale Police Department was shot Saturday evening, Clarksdale Mayor Bill Luckett said. Luckett said the officer was shot in the head. He was flown to Regional Medical Center and is on a ventilator in critical condition, Luckett said. Doctors are still trying to extract the bullet. The officer was identified Sunday as Cpl. Derrick Couch. Memphis Police officers, including Interim Director Michael Rallings, were at Regional Medical Center on Saturday night when he arrived. The shooting happened when Couch was responding to an armed robbery at the Corner Grocery at the corner of Second Street and Sunflower Avenue, Luckett said. Two men robbed the store and left, according to the mayor. Police were called; they put out a suspect description, and officers started searching for the robbers. Couch saw one of the men on First Street and Leflore Avenue, a few blocks away from the Corner Grocery, and went to stop him, Luckett said. The suspect shot him and then ran away. The Clarksdale Police Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation released footage of two robbery suspects who may be connected to the??shooting. Police also have footage of the shooting, but that video was not released. “I’ve seen the video. It’s harrowing,” Luckett said. “As soon as the officer approached him, he just swung around and, bam!” Sunday afternoon, Luckett said the shooting suspect’s father turned him in to the police. This is a developing story.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":185,"startIndex":175,"value":"Clarksdale"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":979,"startIndex":948,"value":"First Street and Leflore Avenue"},"state":"MS - Mississippi","time-day":{"endIndex":173,"startIndex":165,"value":" evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":461,"startIndex":448,"value":"Derrick Couch"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

But on Thursday, relatives consoled the mother of three through her sobs and tears as she talked about her youngest son, Venzel, 14, who was fatally shot the night before in the crime-plagued West Woodlawn neighborhood. “My baby is gone because people just don’t have no remorse and no feeling,” said Richardson, crying hysterically as she held up a photo of her slain son. “My home will never be the same again! My house will never be the same again!” Chicago police said the freshman at Dunbar High School was walking with two other teens in the 6100 block of South Vernon Avenue about 8:20 p.m. Wednesday when a white van pulled up and a gunman inside opened fire. Richardson, who was walking home from a convenience store, was shot in the head and died on the scene. Police said recent conflicts between the Gangster Disciples and Black Disciples street gangs have contributed to recent violence in West Woodlawn, long considered one of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Richardson’s family became outraged on learning from news reports that police labeled Venzel as gang-affiliated. “Where did you get that information from?” his aunt, Denise Richardson, angrily asked in a reference to police. “You can say he was in a gang, but you can’t knock on a door to give your condolence to my sister?” She said police never notified the family about Venzel’s death. One of his cousins who lives near the shooting scene learned about the crime scene on Facebook and went to check it out. It was there that the cousin learned Venzel had been killed, his family said. Laveta Richardson described her son as a typical teenager who loved football and Xbox video games and belonged to Dunbar’s ROTC program. His death comes one month after a friend from Emmett Till Elementary School, Marquise Harris, 16, was fatally shot and in West Woodlawn. “I just went went to his friend’s funeral,” Laveta’s mother said. “Now I’m going to my son’s funeral.” In a separate shooting Wednesday, about 6:50 p.m., a 36-year-old man was shot in the 4600 block of South California Avenue, police said. The man was shot in the shoulder and was able to take himself to Mount Sinai Hospital where his condition had stabilized, police said. The man originally told police he was shot in the 1500 block of South Fairfield Avenue in the Douglas Park neighborhood. Area Central detectives were investigating both shootings, police said.

Amarillo police responded to a shooting call shortly before 8 p.m. in the 500 block of South Florida Street and found an unidentified woman suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Amarillo Police Department Cpl. Shane Chadwick said the woman left the scene by ambulance with injuries not considered life-threatening. Chadwick said the woman — who was from out of town — got into an argument with the suspect, who fired several shots into an SUV the woman was traveling in. The woman, Chadwick said, attempted to drive away in the SUV and jumped out of the vehicle, which continued traveling about a half-block and jumped a curb in the 2800 block of Southwest Fifth Avenue. Medical personnel then picked up the woman at a residence in the 500 block of South Florida Street and transported her to a local hospital. The suspected shooter — a black man about 5 feet, 5 inches tall — left the area in an unknown vehicle. Chadwick said the woman and the alleged shooter knew each other. Police had blocked off the 500 block of South Florida Street and about a half-block of Fifth Avenue east of and west of the intersection late Monday. Police were seen interviewing people who were at houses in the immediate area and marking potential evidence with spray paint in the middle of Florida Street.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":672,"startIndex":659,"value":"several shots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":23,"startIndex":15,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":306,"startIndex":300,"value":"8 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-07","details":{"endIndex":238,"startIndex":171,"value":"just north of historic Sixth Avenue in the San Jacinto neighborhood"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":153,"startIndex":148,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":1084,"startIndex":1079,"value":"black"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1LUIICJ3AAOD7

The loss of Officer Jason Moszer is heartbreaking to us, and along with his family we are grieving the loss of a husband, father, son, brother and fellow officer. "They're in the process of saying goodbye to him". In a statement, Mayor Tim Mahoney said, "A tragedy affecting our men and women in uniform impacts our entire community". Moszer was a highly-decorated soldier who served in Iraq. The suspect, Marcus Schumacher, was found dead in the house but police have not said whether he died of a police bullet or shot himself. When he was 22 years old, Schumacher was charged with shooting Maynard Clauthier, then 17, and Bradley Boswell, then 21, in Grand Forks. Schumacher was sentenced in 1991 to five years in prison, court records show. More recently, he was convicted about three years ago for disorderly conduct and assault. The shooting shook Fargo, which is North Dakota's largest city but rarely sees such violence. Late Thursday, about 200 people gathered for a candlelight vigil in Moszer's honor, KFGO-AM reported. He was just an all-around great guy. Moszer, among the first police officers on the scene, sustained a single gunshot wound while standing on the perimeter of the scene. Police do not believe anyone else has been injured. Officers moved in with an armored BearCat vehicle and took Moszer to the hospital, said Todd, who went with Moszer's wife to the hospital where they were informed he was mortally wounded. WDAY reports the situation with the suspect - who police have not identified publicly - was unresolved until after 6 a.m. Thursday, at which point police said there is no longer an active threat, and people no longer need to shelter in place. Family members were able to escape the gunfire unharmed, Anderson said. Anderson said authorities tried to communicate with the suspect through negotiators, but that he has not responded. With no issued lantern, Alderman mistook a neighboring home for the suspect's residence in the dark. She said she and her girlfriend locked the doors, turned off the lights and hunkered down in the basement for the night. "We were scared. We could hear gunshots very clearly, even from the basement", she said. "I'm ex-military, and I feel a brotherhood being with law enforcement and the military all kind of go together", says Allen Beto of Moorhead.

That suspect, 27-year-old Conrad Rashad Patterson of Zebulon, was taken into custody by the Raleigh Police Department's Fugitive Unit. His arrest comes almost 24 hours after police arrested 25-year-old Major Earl Edwards Jr. of Louisburg in connection with Dominguez's shooting death outside a Raleigh apartment complex Monday. Dominguez was found fatally wounded in the parking lot of the Hodges Creek Apartments in the 2000 block of Hodge Creek Drive around 1:20 a.m., after someone called 911. Meanwhile, Dominguez's coworkers have said they believe he was robbed and assaulted. "He was a great coworker," Amigo taxi driver Joaquin Loyola said. "I still can't believe what happened to him. We're told they wanted to assault him or rob him." Loyola also said that drivers have radios to call for emergencies, but Dominguez never flagged an emergency. Authorities have not confirmed whether Dominguez was robbed, saying they can't discuss specifics about the case.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":185,"startIndex":177,"value":"Raleigh "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":691,"startIndex":682,"value":"1:20 a.m."},"date":"2016-03-14","details":{"endIndex":675,"startIndex":612,"value":"Hodges Creek Apartments in the 2000 block of Hodge Creek Drive "},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":247,"startIndex":236,"value":"27-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":272,"startIndex":248,"value":"Conrad Rashad Patterson "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":424,"startIndex":411,"value":" 25-year-old "},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":445,"startIndex":424,"value":"Major Earl Edwards Jr"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":153,"startIndex":141,"value":"55-year-old "},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":175,"startIndex":153,"value":"Jose Nicolas Dominguez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A18YQFG9YRCPGG

(AP) — In a story Feb. 10 about a gunman fatally shooting two sheriff's deputies and being killed in a shootout, The Associated Press, relying on information from authorities, erroneously reported the gunman's age. David Brian Evans was 68, not 67. A corrected version of the story is below: 2 deputies, suspect dead in suburban shopping area gunfire A gunman fatally shot a sheriff's deputy inside a crowded restaurant at lunchtime Wednesday, then exchanged mortal shots with another deputy nearby By JULIET LINDERMAN Associated Press ABINGDON, Md. (AP) — A gunman fatally shot a sheriff's deputy inside a crowded restaurant at lunchtime Wednesday and killed another deputy in a shootout nearby, authorities and witnesses said. The suspect was killed in the shootout not far from the shopping center where the restaurant was situated, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said. Remarkably, no bystanders were hurt. Police haven't released a motive for the shooting, but the sheriff said he believed the first deputy who approached the gunman was shot because he was wearing a uniform. The shooter, 68-year-old David Brian Evans, had warrants out for his arrest in Harford County and Orange County, Florida, where he was accused of assaulting a police officer. The slain officers were described as a 30-year veteran and a 16-year veteran. The sheriff said he had met with both of their families but was withholding their names because more relatives needed to be notified. "This is a tragic day for the Harford County Sheriff's Office," Gahler said, his eyes moist with tears. "They were two outstanding deputies who served the citizens of this community faithfully." Republican Gov. Larry Hogan ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor the officers. The initial shooting took place inside a Panera restaurant in Abingdon, which is about 20 miles northeast of Baltimore. Sophia Faulkner, 15, said she and her mother were getting lunch and almost sat right next to the gunman. Instead, they chose a booth about 10 feet away because the man appeared "sketchy" and disheveled. He was sitting in the back of the restaurant and hadn't ordered any food, Faulkner said. A sheriff's deputy was called to the restaurant just before noon, presumably because "someone knew who he was," Gahler said. The deputy tried to talk to the man, who was apparently known to officers and workers at the restaurant. The deputy sat down, asked how he was doing, and the man shot him in the head. "I saw him fall back out of his chair, and the blood started coming out," Faulkner said. "I didn't know how to process it. My mom said, 'What's going on?' and I said, 'Get down. Someone just got shot.'" The shooter fled and "everyone started screaming," Faulkner said. Children at the restaurant — out of school because of snowfall — were running around. "I was freaking out so much, and everybody was running to one side of the store. Families were huddling together. I didn't really know what was going on," she said. "You see this stuff online and in movies and on TV when it happens, but you never think you're going to go out to lunch one day with your mom and it's just going to happen." Her mother, Lynn Faulkner, a registered nurse, said that she recognized the man and believed he was mentally ill and in need of social services. "I've seen him there frequently, and I've seen him at areas of the library," she said. "He's definitely in need of mental health care, and he never should have had a gun." "He knew what he was doing, because he shot right for the head," she continued. "Apparently, the policeman tried to come up to him, 'Hi, how are you doing,' — he's living in this store — and, 'Can you try to move on?' or 'Why are you here today?' and that's when he immediately pulled out the gun and shot him." Bartender Mike Davis was working at the Ocean City Brewing Co.'s Taphouse when he saw two women and a child run from Panera to his restaurant's back door. "They were hysterical. They said they heard gunshots," he said. "We locked the door and went to talk to a cop. The cop said not to let anyone in. Then, we heard more gunshots — pop, pop, pop, pop — from down in the shopping center. It was hectic." Witnesses gave officers a description of the gunman and told them which way he was headed, the sheriff said. Deputies caught up with him and shots were exchanged, the sheriff said. One of the deputies was treated at the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. Video showed an ambulance and a sheriff's car escorted by police on motorcycles leaving, apparently taking the body to the nearby state medical examiner's office. Police lined each side of the street and saluted when the vehicles drove by. The sheriff said investigators believe Evans acted alone and there is no further threat to the community. "The restaurant was very full at lunchtime," Gahler said. "Thankfully, no one else was injured." The shopping center is called the Boulevard at Box Hill. It has a mix of shops, restaurants, a grocery store and a bank. Yellow tape blocked off the Panera and Taphouse restaurants Wednesday afternoon, but people were coming and going freely at other businesses after the shooting. Panera spokeswoman Amanda Cardosi said the company is heartbroken. "Our thoughts and actions now are directed towards the victims and their families.

Matthew Ray Dobbins, 29, was pronounced dead at Northwest Texas Hospital, Randall County Sheriff's Office spokesman Danny Alexander said. At 4:43 p.m. Friday, an alarm company asked deputies to investigate a possible break-in at a home in the 14800 block of XIT Trail, located about two miles east of Interstate 27 between McCormick and Rockwell roads, Alexander said in a news release. Deputies determined a person, later identified as Dobbins, was in the house and set up a perimeter. The residents who live at the home were not there at the time of the reported break-in, Alexander said. When contacted, the residents told deputies firearms were kept in the house. At 5:24 p.m., shots were fired. Details of what led deputies to shoot into the house were not immediately available. Dobbins, who was inside the home, was taken by ambulance to Northwest Texas Hospital. No law enforcement officers were injured. The deputies involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, Alexander said. The Randall County Sheriff’s Office and the Texas Rangers on Saturday continued to investigate the events that led to the shooting. Dobbins had been booked into Randall County Jail five times dating back to 2004 for offenses ranging from drug possession to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault against a public servant, jail records show. He was last booked into the jail Nov. 8 on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":237,"startIndex":229,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":919,"startIndex":910,"value":"5:24 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":506,"startIndex":482,"value":"14800 block of XIT Trail"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":262,"startIndex":260,"value":"29"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":258,"startIndex":239,"value":"Matthew Ray Dobbins"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9
2514	http://abruzzo.tv/news/2016/02/13/nyc-police-officer-found-guilty-of-manslaughter-in-brooklyn/	NYC police officer found guilty of manslaughter in Brooklyn stairway shooting	NYC police officer found guilty of manslaughter in Brooklyn stairway shootingFollowing the fatal execution-style shooting of two officers in December 2014, Lynch all but declared war against the Black citizens of NY, calling for a "wartime" police force in reaction to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Liang faces up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced later this year. Why does it matter? Liang and his partner went to investigate the scene after Liang's gun fired, where they discovered Gurley lying in a pool of blood along with his girlfriend. The bullet ricocheted off the wall and killed Gurley, who was unarmed. The 28-year-old's girlfriend also testified the officers didn't help her in trying to perform CPR. But an uncertainty remains: Brooklyn state Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun has yet to rule on Liang's lawyers' request to dismiss the charges; Liang also was convicted of official misconduct, a misdemeanor. Prosecutor Joe Alexis argued that Liang showed poor judgment, again and again, and that the shooting wasn't an accident beyond the officer's control. "I was panicking. I was in shock, in disbelief that someone was actually hit", he said. Liang's attorneys have argued that the trigger spring may have been defective, requiring less pressure than what's necessary to fire an NYPD-issued Glock 9mm. "It says to the NYPD, you have to be very cautious about taking your gun out", said Liang's defense lawyer Robert Brown, "to the point of risking your own life". On one side sat mostly black friends and family of Gurley; on the other side sat mostly Chinese American family and supporters of Liang. Peter Liang, 28, is the first NY police officer convicted in an on-duty death since 2005. An attorney for an officer convicted of fatally shooting a man in a dark public housing stairwell says he will appeal the verdict. But the DA said that the verdict was in "no way a conviction" of the city police, the New York Law Journal reported. A shot is fired from the gun. Throughout the trial Liang's defense repeatedly called such a strike "a million to one", both due to the fact that the bullet bounced off a wall and the likelihood of someone walking in the stairwell at exactly that time. In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he hoped the verdict would bring some closure to Gurley's family. He testified that his gun went off accidentally and that he didn't realize someone was below him in the stairwell. The chokehold death of Garner, an unarmed 43-year-old man, sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. According to the Times, it's rare for officers in NY to even be put on trial for a death in the line of duty, let alone to be found guilty. Earlier, they had reheard testimony from Liang and other witnesses. The gunman later killed himself.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1327,"startIndex":1318,"value":"Glock 9mm"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":59,"startIndex":51,"value":"Brooklyn"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1643,"startIndex":1640,"value":" 28"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1639,"startIndex":1628,"value":"Peter Liang"},"race":{"endIndex":1596,"startIndex":1579,"value":"Chinese American "}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":501,"startIndex":495,"value":"Gurley"},"race":{"endIndex":1519,"startIndex":1514,"value":"black"},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3DI3U61BD56J0
2533	http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/05/gage-park-mass-murder-victims-were-all-members-of-same-family/	Gage Park Mass Murder Victims Identified « CBS Chicago	Gage Park Mass Murder Victims Identified « CBS Chicago(CBS) — Relatives have confirmed the six people killed in a Gage Park home on Thursday were three generations of the same family. Police Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy also clarified that there were four adults and two children killed, after police earlier said the victims were five adults and one child. Police said the victims were two boys – ages 10 and 13 – two men, and two women. The Cook County Medical Examiner ruled all six deaths homicides. A relative confirmed the victims are Noe Martinez Sr. and his wife, Rosaura Hernandez, both in their 60s; their son Noe Martinez Jr., who was in his 40s; their daughter Maria Herminia Martinez, who was in her 30s; and the daughter’s two sons, 10-year-old Alexis and 13-year-old Leonardo. Maria Herminia Martinez suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The other five died of “sharp and blunt force injuries,” the ME’s office said in a statement. Noe Martinez Sr. and the two children died of stab wounds, the ME said. Rosaura Henandez and Noe Martinez Jr. were stabbed and also suffered “blunt force” injuries. None of the deaths were ruled a suicide. Police say there are no suspects in custody. Family photos of six members of a family found killed in a home in Gage Park. Relatives have identified the victims as Noe Martinez Sr. (left), his wife Rosa Hernandez (upper right), their son Noe Martinez Jr. (center of upper right), their daughter Maria Herminia Martinez (center of lower left), and their grandchildren Alexis (right of lower right) and Leonardo (left of lower right). | Source: GoFundMe Surviving relatives have set up a GoFundMe page to help the family’s survivors raise money, in hopes of sending their bodies back to Mexico to be buried. As of Friday morning, more than $2,800 had been raised. The victims were found dead Thursday inside a home in the 5700 block of South California Avenue, after police were called to conduct a well-being check. Roy said police were contacted by a co-worker of one of the victims, who became concerned after that person had not been at work for several days. Roy said the house was locked when police arrived, and when officers looked through windows, they saw a body inside, so they forced their way inside, and found five other people dead inside. He would not say where in the house the victims were found. “Despite some rumors and reports to the contrary yesterday afternoon … the victims were not bound, and there did not appear to be any ransacking of the house,” Roy said. The chief declined to comment on any evidence that might have been recovered at the scene, including whether a murder weapon was found, but he said there were no signs of gunfire in the house. “This is a complex investigation. We are working meticulously, which means we take our time,” Roy said. “We take our time, but it’s still with a sense of urgency, to make sure that we haven’t missed anything that’s going to lead to the solution of this case.” Roy said it is “way too early” to know if one specific person in the home was targeted, and the others were killed because they were witnesses. “That would be conjecture,” he said. Investigators so far have declined to say if the killer might have been among the dead, or if a suspect was still at large, but Roy said police believe there is no threat to the public. “Given the nature of the scene, the fact that the doors were locked, the house was not disheveled, and other factors, it’s pretty much confined to the home, which leads us in that direction,” he said. Roy said all of the victims suffered blunt trauma, but he declined to comment on reports that at least one of the victims was stabbed multiple times. “That’s something that’s under investigation by the M.E.’s office. The medical examiner is doing autopsies on the bodies this morning. That’s within the medical examiner’s area of responsibility, and I’ll defer questions on that to him,” Roy said. Police have talked to several family members, including a relative who was coming in from Texas on Friday to talk to investigators.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":123,"startIndex":114,"value":"Gage Park"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":128,"startIndex":109,"value":"in a Gage Park home"},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":718,"startIndex":715,"value":"30s"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":817,"startIndex":794,"value":"Maria Herminia Martinez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9

The shooter left the home after a dispute with another person, returned with a gun and shot into the home, Alfaro said. Bullets struck six people. Tyquone Greer, a Division I college basketball prospect at Orr Academy High School, was one of three victims taken to Stroger Hospital, a hospital official said. Greer and his family could not be reached for comment Sunday. But his coach, Louis Adams, said Greer was home from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. “He's doing pretty well,” Adams said. “Fortunately the bullet went in and out.” Two others were taken to Stroger and were stabilized, a 17-year-old boy shot in the face and an 18-year-old man shot in the arm, police said. A 20-year-old man shot in the chest, back and leg was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was listed in serious condition. A 22-year-old man was also taken to Mount Sinai with a gunshot wound to the calf. His condition was stabilized, police said. About the same time, a 20-year-old woman arrived at Loretto Hospital shot in the abdomen and lower leg. She was transferred to Mount Sinai Medical Center and listed in serious condition. Police did not immediately take anyone into custody or release a suspect description. Greer's team is considered a favorite in the Class 3A basketball tournament. Asked whether he had heard from a lot of college coaches Sunday, Adams said he had taken “a million calls.” “With the grace of God, everything is going to be OK with his career. … Right now we just want the kid to get well.” Freelance reporter Mike Helfgot contributed.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":72,"startIndex":65,"value":"chicago"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-06","details":{"endIndex":136,"startIndex":117,"value":"Austin neighborhood"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":151,"startIndex":144,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":440,"startIndex":427,"value":"Tyquone Greer"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":896,"startIndex":894,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":936,"startIndex":934,"value":"18"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":984,"startIndex":982,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1111,"startIndex":1108,"value":" 22"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":1257,"startIndex":1255,"value":"20"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1FGKIKJYSL1MI
2555	http://www.timesheraldonline.com/article/NH/20160206/NEWS/160209846	Young man fatally shot in Vallejo	Young man fatally shot in VallejoA young man died Saturday afternoon after being shot multiple times in Vallejo. The shooting happened around 11:30 a.m. in front of Springs Road Healthcare Center at the intersection of Springs Road and Heartwood Avenue, police said. The drivers of two vehicles, silver and red sedans, had a confrontation and shots were fired into one of the vehicles. It was unclear what their argument was about as of press time. The victim, an 18-year-old Hispanic male, was mortally wounded from multiple gunshots, police said. His identification was withheld pending notification of next of kin. Emergency responders first to the scene attempted to administer CPR to the victim before he was transported to a local hospital for additional care. He later died from his wounds at the hospital.

2577	http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2014-12-27/police-name-sycamore-shooting-suspect	Police name Sycamore shooting suspect | Amarillo Globe-News	Police name Sycamore shooting suspect | Amarillo Globe-NewsAmarillo police have identified a man suspected of shooting another man in the head Friday afternoon on Sycamore Avenue as Pshard Andre Smith, 20. At 1:44 p.m., police responded to the 1200 block of Sycamore, where they found the victim, a 22-year-old man who has not been identified. The victim was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and remains in critical condition as of midnight Friday. Police taped off a portion of the 1200 block of Sycamore Avenue in north Amarillo. Possibly five to six shots were fired, and police used a canine to search for shell casings outside. Smith was apprehended at another location in west Amarillo, and was booked into Potter County jail on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Potter-Randall Special Crimes Coordinator Lt. Erick Bohannon said by phone. Officers recovered a gun thought to be used in the shooting at a field near the intersection of Northeast Ninth Avenue and North Taylor Street. Police said the shooting may be related to a wreck that occurred Friday afternoon in the intersection of Ninth Avenue and North Fillmore Street. Possible witnesses and family followed the victim to the hospital, police said. Tina Hill, a resident on Sycamore Avenue, said she heard the shot and ran to help. When she got to the scene of the shooting, she said there was a woman attempting to help the victim. She said the woman told her the suspect threatened to shoot the woman, too. Hill said she has known the shooting victim since he was a little boy. “He was just like a son to me,” Hill said. “I loved him … it hurts.” Smith had previously faced a murder charge in April 2012 after police said he fatally shot an Amarillo convenience store owner. He was later cleared of the charge. Amarillo SWAT officers arrested Smith, then 17, at Hamlet Park after an unidentified eyewitness selected him in a photo lineup. Smith was booked into Potter County jail on $1 million bond. Smith was charged in the shooting death of Adrian Chavez, 47, after police said two black men wearing bandannas entered La Esquina convenience store on 1500 N. Mirror St., and one man shot Chavez. The eyewitness described Smith’s physical appearance and his clothing at the time, court documents said. A Potter County grand jury indicted Smith on a murder charge May 16, 2013 in connection with the shooting, but he was released from custody July 31, 2013 after his case was dismissed, Globe-News files show. DNA on a Halloween mask near the store linked Matthew D’Breeze Mason, 21, to the shooting, according to a criminal complaint. Mason was convicted of first-degree murder in the shooting on Sept. 24, Texas Department of Public Safety records show. The Sycamore shooting remains under investigation. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the Special Crimes Unit at 806-378-9468.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":563,"startIndex":552,"value":"five to six"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":67,"startIndex":59,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":218,"startIndex":209,"value":"1:44 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":542,"startIndex":494,"value":"1200 block of Sycamore Avenue in north Amarillo."},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":159,"startIndex":150,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":204,"startIndex":202,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":200,"startIndex":182,"value":"Pshard Andre Smith"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":301,"startIndex":299,"value":"22"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A3DI3U61BD56J0

The shooting was reported at Independence High School, about 12 miles outside of Phoenix. The two teenagers were shot just before 8 a.m. in an "isolated" area of campus, Glendale police said. Officers found both girls dead at the scene from a single gunshot wound, Officer Tracey Breeden, spokesperson for the Glendale Police Department, said at a news conference. She said this was not an active shooter situation. The girls were found together with a weapon near them, Breeden said. Both girls were in the 10th grade, she added. Police do not believe there are any outstanding suspects, Breeden said. The incident was isolated and the school and neighborhood are now safe, according to police. "This was not any sort of active shooter incident and there is no danger to the school or community at this time," police said. Police said the campus was on lockdown. Police had no knowledge of any threats to the school, faculty or any individuals, Breeden said.

2675	http://counton2.com/2016/02/12/new-clinton-ad-features-husband-of-mother-emanuel-shooting-victim/	New Clinton ad features husband of Mother Emanuel shooting victim	New Clinton ad features husband of Mother Emanuel shooting victimCHARLESTON, SC – A new Hillary Clinton ad hits the airwaves this weekend and it features the Reverend Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed in the Mother Emanuel shootings last June. Rev. Thompson says ever since his wife’s unexpected death last June, he has been working towards tighter gun legislation for the people of South Carolina. “This is my mission. My mission now is to advocate for gun control and changing the gun laws and that they enforce them,” explained Rev. Thompson. The campaign released the ad Friday. It features Reverend Thompson sitting in a rocking chair with an empty rocking chair next to him, remembering that night, and the horrifying moment he got the call about a shooting at the church. Thompson described June 17th to News 2’s Matt Alba by saying, “When I got to the room, the first person I saw was Felicia and her granddaughter, who is one of the survivors, and Miss Polly; and Felicia looked at me and she said, ‘Myra is gone.’ Oh yeah, I lost it.” Thompson says he wants to turn a tragedy into change. “I’m going to use every platform and every avenue I can to spread that message.” Thompson believes Hillary Clinton is committed to changing our gun laws and he’s standing with her to make sure nothing like the massacre at Mother Emanuel ever happens again. “The time was right. She came at the right time where I could put this out on a higher level, where more people see it and more people hear it, and I think she just did the same thing I did that’s all.” Thompson explained how it was his decision to tell his story and he was not forced into the situation in any way. In the last few months, it hasn’t been easy for the Thompson family. They lost two other family members since Myra. Rev. Thompson said his cousin was shot and killed in North Charleston two weeks ago. Another family friend was killed due to gun violence a few months back. “We’ve had like three people in our family to be killed by gun violence.” Rev. Thomson continued, “I’m not saying this in reference to people losing their right to bear arms! We are not trying to take anybody’s right away to go hunting with their guns. We’re saying that guns are getting into the wrong hands. The laws are not being enforced; there are loopholes in the law and we just want those things changed. We want those things to be focused on and looked at and hopefully the politicians will do the right thing and make those changes.” The new Clinton campaign will begin airing on Channel 2 this Sunday.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":75,"startIndex":65,"value":"CHARLESTON"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"SC - South Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Authorities later identified the man as Kor Yang. The shooting occurred near 9th and Wilson around 5:30 a.m. Manitowoc police say the suspect fled the scene following the shooting. At a news conference Friday, Capt. Larry Zimney says no one is in custody, but the public at large is not believed to be in any danger. Yang's wife, two stepsons and grandchild were in the home at the time of the shooting. The State Crime Lab and State Patrol have been called in to help investigate. Police say that is their standard protocol. Manitowoc police say this was not a random act and that they are "looking into all possible motives." Officials ask anyone with information that might be able to assist their investigation to call CrimeStoppers at 920-683-4466. Officials say the last time Manitowoc police had to investigate a homicide was in 2001. I’m sorry you feel the need to be so hostile over every post here “unicorns and rainbows”… You must live in this little hick town or you wouldn’t be getting so offended at the difference between the sheriff & police departments… I’m sure you are probably connected in someway to one department or the other. Here is the point, whether it’s the “sheriffs”or the “police” they are all viewed as one in the same to most people & they are public servants in that little shit town that no one ever even knew was on the map until the AVERY/DASSEY case came to light… So I’m sorry you are one of the 20 residents of Manitowoc that is feeling the brunt of the outrage over this case/documentary and feel they have to be defensive because your poor little town is viewed as being corrupt. Boo Hoo..Also only people who are insecure about themselves and their level of intelligence have to write posts about how uneducated everyone else is. If that makes you feel better than consider this post my contribution to your therapy…And you are welcome, consider it free of charge! Just curious, why do you believe he is “guilty as sin”? I ask because, I did watch the Netflix series, HOWEVER, I did not conclude it by thinking he was innocent. It led me to research the trial records, the ‘evidence’ presented, etc. In which case, NOW I believe they are innocent. The people I have encountered who believe he is guilty as sin have just been ignorant. So, please, enlighten me with evidence that he is guilty because, until I know for sure, I can’t sleep at night, it’s a wonder those involved in this case can.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":196,"startIndex":187,"value":"Manitowoc"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":345,"startIndex":336,"value":" 5:30 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":202,"startIndex":197,"value":"home "},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":222,"startIndex":215,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":107,"startIndex":96,"value":"51-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":286,"startIndex":278,"value":"Kor Yang"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1ODVXVCDHOVF1
2682	http://cjonline.com/news/2015-02-11/one-shot-tpd-officer-east-topeka-after-grabbing-officers-gun	One shot by TPD officer in East Topeka after grabbing for officer's gun | CJOnline.com	One shot by TPD officer in East Topeka after grabbing for officer's gun | CJOnline.comOne person was hospitalized after being shot by a Topeka police officer late Wednesday morning after attempting to grab the officer’s gun when an investigation into a suspicious vehicle turned into an altercation in an East Topeka alley, police officials said. The person who was shot was taken by American Medical Response ambulance to a local hospital with injuries that police officials said weren’t thought to be life-threatening. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation was called in to be the lead agency investigating the incident. Police Sgt. Colleen Stuart said officers responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle about 10:30 a.m. in the west alley of the 2700 block of S.E. Madison. When officers arrived, they located a car matching the caller’s description. Stuart said an officer approached the vehicle and obtained identification from the two occupants. After running a registration check, the license tag on the car was reported to have been stolen. The officer then went back to the car and again made contact with the driver, Stuart said. The driver then tried to grab the officer’s gun. A struggle ensued and the officer was able to “break free” from the driver, Stuart said. The officer fired an unknown number of shots, striking the driver, who was then taken to a hospital for treatment. Neither the person who was wounded nor the officer who fired the shots had been identified by mid-afternoon Wednesday. What appeared to be a large pool of blood was visible outside the front passenger door of a black four-door Chevrolet Impala that was parked facing south in the alley behind a mobile home at 2715 S.E. Madison. A woman who lives in the block where the shooting occurred said she heard several gunshots ring out at the time the incident occurred Wednesday morning. An unusually high number of Topeka police cruisers — at least 15 at one time — were on the scene, located about two blocks west of S.E. 27th and Adams. Police officers blocked the 2700 block of S.E. Madison and its west alley as the crime scene was established. Several high-ranking officers from the Topeka Police Department — including Deputy Chief Tony Kirk and Maj. Jerry Stanley — were on the scene. Shawnee County District Attorney Chad Taylor also surveyed the crime scene as he walked with police officers. The Shawnee County Sheriff’s Office typically investigates shootings involving Topeka police officers. However, in this case, it was the KBI — the state’s top law enforcement agency — that was handling the investigation. “When we get calls for assistance, we’re more than happy to assist, when we have the manpower,” said Mark Malick, KBI spokesman. “In this case, we did.” Malick said the KBI’s crime scene unit was on site and investigating the incident Wednesday afternoon. Responds to all incidents of this nature. Chad Taylor does an excellent job of actually going out to a scene to see for himself what it looked like and what took place. Which is extremely important to having a good idea of the totality of the circumstances. He does this or has an assistant DA respond to all homocide scenes, fatality wrecks , officer involved shootings, really any scene that is going to definitely lead to an extensive involvement from his agency. This is something Bob Hecht never did and Taylor has fostered a good working relationship with law enforcement. Sorry Bob Losier nobodies in big trouble by Taylor's arrival. He responds to all of these scenes. If there is an issue it will be addressed, I realize you like to stir the pot with your comments and that's cool. But this ones kinda childish and inappropriate. Why don't you wait till the facts come out. Otherwise we get people burning down their own city and stuff. "Code 13" is actually "Signal 13", which stands for Officer in Danger. When that is aired by the officer, Dispatch immediately repeats it, and advises all units, both city and county, of where the officer, in this case, is at. Usually, every officer that is not on a call, or on something like a car stop, clears what they are doing and responds to the officer that needs help. KHP that is assigned to Shawnee County, as well as any other agencies, such as TPS police, Park Police, Wildlife and Parks Law Enforcement, etc., have been know to show up to these calls if they have a radio that is capable of receiving TPD/SNSO traffic, to assist the officer. KBI and the D.A. would not have responded just because the Signal 13 was put out. They will wait to be contacted by the agency (or agencies) involved, and told what is going on, then make a decision on whether to respond to the scene. AMR and TFD also would not respond until called, due to the possibility of a still dangerous situation being present in the area. Same with news reporters. They may listen to see what is going on for a few minutes, and start making calls, but won't just jump in a vehicle and go, because it might still be a little (or a lot) dangerous to be there, or it could be absolutely nothing at all that happened there. I know all of this from working for AMR for many years, and from being a former LEO in a nearby county for several years. This is how it works. If the guy did actually try to get the officer's gun from him, to the officer, his life was just as much threatened as if the man had a gun pointed to his head. He had every right to use deadly force at that point to stop the threat. The man had already proved that he was going to try to take the officer's gun. His intent, at that point is considered obvious in the many court cases that have been heard already... And that is that if he is fighting the officer for the officer's weapon, the suspect has the intent to use that weapon to kill the officer. Therefore, it is a deadly force situation. If the officer did not use deadly force, and attempted to use other force, and it was ineffective, the suspect could still attempt to get the officer's gun, or attempt to incapacitate the officer, to be able to get his/her weapon, for the purpose of killing the officer, or others. This ruling has been made time and time again in state and federal courts for many years, and is taught in just about every law enforcement academy there is. That is why when we go through the academy, we have to learn to protect our weapon, and that is also why we wear holsters that have security mechanisms built in them to help prevent someone else from pulling the weapon from the holster, other than the officer that is wearing it.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":38,"startIndex":27,"value":"East Topeka"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":720,"startIndex":710,"value":" 10:30 a.m"},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":181,"oldEnd":180,"oldStart":172,"startIndex":173,"value":"morning "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

One-year-old Autumn Johnson was shot and killed while sleeping in her crib. The baby had just celebrated her first birthday last week. She was struck in the head as approximately 10 bullets sprayed the garage of her family’s house. Witnesses saw two men near the scene in a four-door sedan, KTLA reports. According to the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, the violence was gang related though the intended target is unknown.”It looks like somebody drove up and were shooting into the house at somebody else and the baby caught a stray round,” said LASD Lt. John Corrina. Police arrived at the scene to see the child’s father holding his wounded daughter, and rushed her to a local hospital in a squad car (emergency responders had not yet arrived). Doctors worked to save her life, but Autumn’s was pronounced dead not long after her arrival. Baby Autumn was originally reported as being 3 months old. The family has launched a GoFund Me account to raise money for her funeral. Anyone with information on the shooting is encouraged to contact the LASD, or make an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477. See more below.

Police continue their investigation. At 9 p.m. on March 26, Amarillo police officers were sent to the 3100 block of Redwood in reference to a large fight and a report that someone was armed with a firearm. Upon arrival, officers located four victims: a 54-year-old man had a gunshot wound to the back and right arm; a 20-year-old man had a gunshot wound to the leg; a 24-year-old man had a gunshot wound to his lower back; and a 19-year-old man had a gunshot wound to the lower back and buttocks. All four were transported to a local hospital to have their non-life threatening injuries treated. While medical attention was given to the victims, officers began speaking with numerous people at the scene to determine what happened. As of now, no suspects have been identified. However, APD is looking into several persons of interest. Possible suspects will be charged with aggravated assault if arrest warrants are issued. Residents who live near the park say that fights like this happen all the time. The incident remains under investigation.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":231,"startIndex":223,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":308,"startIndex":302,"value":"9 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-26","details":{"endIndex":385,"startIndex":364,"value":"3100 block of Redwood"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":261,"startIndex":255,"value":"night."}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":517,"startIndex":515,"value":"54"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":582,"startIndex":580,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":632,"startIndex":630,"value":"24"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":693,"startIndex":691,"value":"19"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME

According to multiple reports, a man was shot and killed in his home in Manitowoc, seat of Manitowoc County, Friday morning. FOX 11 says the victim, identified as 52-year-old Kor Yang, had answered a knock at his door around 5:30 in the morning. The suspect is said to have run off after the shooting. According to the station, police are still looking into a motive for the killing, and are offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to an arrest. ABC 9 reports the man lived in the home with his wife, and that three children were present at the time. While left “shocked” by the attack, none of them were hurt. Police believe the shooting was not a “random act,” the station says. Meanwhile, neighbors and community members are disturbed after the incident, and according to a WBAY report, “frustrated” over the “reputation” the area is developing in light of “Making a Murderer.” The series explores the case of Steven Avery, a Manitowoc County resident who was accused and eventually convicted of murder in 2005 – not long after he’d been freed from years of imprisonment for a rape he didn’t commit. The documentary follows Avery’s defense team as they try to make the case that Avery was framed by Manitowoc County authorities. The popularity of the show has put the community and its law enforcement in a global spotlight. FOX 11 says police are pointing out that this weekend’s homicide has nothing to do with the Avery case. According to WBAY, it’s Manitowoc’s first shooting homicide since 2001.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":327,"oldEnd":326,"oldStart":317,"startIndex":318,"value":"Manitowoc"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":475,"oldEnd":474,"oldStart":470,"startIndex":471,"value":"5:30"},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":814,"oldEnd":813,"oldStart":723,"startIndex":724,"value":"the man lived in the home with his wife, and that three children were present at the time."},"state":"WI - Wisconsin","time-day":{"endIndex":490,"oldEnd":489,"oldStart":482,"startIndex":483,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":411,"oldEnd":410,"oldStart":408,"startIndex":409,"value":"52"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":429,"oldEnd":428,"oldStart":420,"startIndex":421,"value":"Kor Yang"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A22K31FFQVQL9H

The Walton County sheriff says he's taking the case very seriously after a dog was found with a bullet in his head. Toby is a lab mix that couldn't be sweeter, according to his caregivers. Despite his injuries, Toby is still wagging his tail. "He's done nothing but wag his tail, he hasn't tried to bite," says Dr. Asha Wise with Monroe Animal Care Hospital. "Even when we're obviously hurting him, touching his wound, he's a really nice dog." Two deputies found Toby with a shot to the face while out on a scene in Good Hope on Sunday. An x-ray of the dog's head shows where the bullet was lodged. The officers then called another officer, whose wife works with an animal rescue group. They eventually brought him to the Monroe Animal Care Hospital, where he had surgery Tuesday. He will likely need several more, with months of rehab costing possibly thousands of dollars. "He had a big hole in his nose and he was bleeding from both of his nostrils," Dr. Wise says. Toby is also very skinny from malnutrition. A woman in the neighborhood told police Toby was a stray she took in. She gave him up to the rescue group. Now, the Sheriff says they're looking for the person who did this to the gentle animal. "Our district attorney, our prosecutor, she is a huge animal lover," says Sheriff Joe Chapman. "And I would hate for her prosecuting me for endangering an animal." "I don't know how anybody could shoot a really sweet dog in the face," Wise says.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":623,"startIndex":617,"value":"a shot"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":669,"startIndex":660,"value":"Good Hope"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":264,"startIndex":260,"value":"Toby"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A27I59DGZEHAXO

Officers were dispatched to a Panera Bread location in Abingdon for an investigation late Wednesday morning, according to the Harford County Sheriff’s Office. There, a suspect fired at a deputy, striking him. The suspect fled and was seen heading toward nearby apartments, the sheriff’s office said. A second deputy attempted to make contact and also was struck by gunfire. Additional deputies fired at the gunman, who was pronounced dead at the scene. “Today’s a sad for the Harford County Sheriff’s Office and the citizens of Hartford County who we are sworn to serve. It’s with great sadness that I tell you both deputies who were shot earlier today have succumbed to their injuries,” said Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler. One of the deputies was a 30-year veteran of the agency; the other had served for 16 years. They were not identified by name. The shooting suspect has been identified as David Bryant Evans, 67. Evans had at least two outstanding warrants in two states, including one in Florida for assaulting a police officer, Gahler said.

2809	http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2013-08-05/police-investigating-incident-virginia-street	Suspicious death appears to be fatal shooting | Amarillo Globe-News	Suspicious death appears to be fatal shooting | Amarillo Globe-NewsPolice are investigating what they think was a fatal shooting Monday at a west Amarillo duplex, though they have yet to classify the death as a homicide. Amarillo police Lt. Erick Bohannon of the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit said a man died at a local hospital Monday evening after suffering “what appeared to be a gunshot wound” to his upper body at 824-B S. Virginia St. Bohannon was hesitant to rule the death a homicide. “The circumstances are suspicious enough that (Special Crimes) were called out here,” Bohannon said, adding that no other injuries were immediately reported. He said an autopsy is scheduled for Thursday. Police received a shots fired call about 6:27 p.m. Monday, Bohannon said, and police soon swarmed the area. Police vehicles blocked access to South Virginia Street at Line Avenue and had yellow police tape around the duplex, which is owned by Kenneth Roger Pool and Melanie J. Pool but is occupied by non-owners, Potter-Randall Appraisal District records show. Manson Jennings said he came out of his residence just north of the duplex on Virginia Street after hearing police sirens. Jennings said three police cruisers were traveling fast west on Line Avenue, stopped in front of the duplex and officers ran inside. He said officers came out and retrieved a triage kit, went back inside and carried a male out. A man and a woman that came out of the B side of the duplex were placed into squad cars, Jennings said. Melinda Brown, who lives across Line Avenue at 822 Virginia St., said she was watching the TV show “COPS” at about 6:45 when someone alerted her to the police surrounding her neighbors’ duplex less than 50 yards away.

The robbery happened at Smokies House of Pipes in the 5700 block of SW Green Oaks Boulevard on December 7. Surveillance video of the robbery clearly shows three people entering the store, with one of them immediately hanging back and lingering by the front door. Police say the suspects are two men and a woman. The men, at least one of them armed, confronted store employees while the woman stood as a lookout at the door. Vanessa Harrison with police said one of the men grabbed an employee and put a gun to his head. “Had him at gunpoint, grabbing him by his collar and moving him around the store. It looks like they were trying to intimidate the employees to open up the safe.” The the other male robber took money from the cash register and demanded more cash from the safe while the employee had a gun to his head. “We want to catch these suspects because this situation could have been a lot worse,” Harrison said. The first suspect is described as light-skinned Black or Hispanic male. He is believed to be in his late teens to early 20’s and stands between 5’10” and 6’1”. At the time of the robbery he had some facial hair and was wearing a black beanie cap and a black jacket with gray sleeves and a hood. The second suspect is described as a Black male, also in his late teens or early 20’s, and standing between 5’10” and 6’1”. This suspect was wearing a black Chicago Bulls cap, black jacket with a white stripe on the sleeve, black pants, and black and white sneakers when the robbery took place. Information on the third suspect is limited. Police only know that she was a Black female, in the same age range as the men, and had a slender build. Police are asking that anyone who has information about the robbery of Smokies House of Pipes or can identify the wanted suspects contact Arlington Detective Holloway at 817-459-5739. Tips can also be left anonymously with Tarrant County Crime Stoppers at 817-469-TIPS. (©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The shooting happened about 8 p.m. Monday, eight blocks away the busy Mardi Gras parades. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand says the incident began at Oakwood Mall in Jefferson Parish after three people reported that a man brandished a gun toward them. Normand says a deputy approached the man, there was an altercation, and the man fled in a car. Normand says the man crossed the Mississippi River into New Orleans, where he lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a pole. Normand says the man put his car in reverse and deputies opened fire. The man was pronounced dead at the scene and a woman was taken to the hospital. Her condition is unknown. ___ 10:40 a.m. Mardi Gras is cold, but cold can depend on perspective. Amanda Brooks of suburban Gretna and cousin Janet Strode of Chicago were bundled up, waiting for Zulu’s parade to arrive downtown. Winds gusting up to 30 mph made mid-40s temperatures feel like the upper 30s. Baby Maria slept in Brooks’ arms, nestled in a hat, snowsuit and an adult’s quilted jacket with the hood as a windbreaker for her face.

Police said the fight involved sticks, knives, bats and guns. Authorities say two people were killed and one critically injured after an armed fight broke out among a group of people. The mother who lost her son said she's desperate for answers about his death. Lashawn Forshey was comforted by friends moments after learning that her son, Jacari Cook, 29, had been killed. "I don't know who did this to my son. My son was a good guy and I don't know why him," she said. Forshey said her son and his father-in-law were killed. "They were very close, two peas in a pod," she said. Forshey said the two may have tried to intervene in a domestic dispute. "There was some type of fight an altercation taking place here at 79 Cole Drive with bats, sticks and knives, things of that nature," Marin County Sheriff Lt. Doug Pittman said. That fight ended in gunfire, leaving another man wounded. "Oh it's sad, two nice guys, it's hard to understand," family friend Herbert Wade said. Wade was shocked by the senseless crime. "We're not going to have a very good Super Bowl Sunday in Marin City today," he said. "This appears to be shall I say, an isolated incident," Pittman said.

Zachary Scott Cooper, 28, of Canadian was found slumped over in the seat of his white Hyundai at 8:33 p.m. Wednesday in the parking lot of McDonalds, 1815 S. Grand St. Special Crimes detectives determined Cooper died from a gunshot wound to the torso. The investigation into the death has uncovered video surveillance images that show Cooper driving the Hyundai with a white or Hispanic male passenger to Walmart, 3700 E. Interstate 40, earlier Wednesday. The passenger exited Cooper’s vehicle and went inside. A few minutes later, a different person approached Cooper’s vehicle and spoke with him through the passenger-side window for a few minutes before getting in the car and leaving with Cooper, police said. In between the stops at Walmart and McDonalds, another person got into the Hyundai. After Cooper was shot while sitting in his vehicle in the McDonalds parking lot, the two men got out of his car and entered another vehicle driven by another person and drove off. The second vehicle is described as a two-door sports coupe, possibly gray in color, police said. It is unclear whether the man talking on the phone in the video in Walmart was present during the shooting. Police are searching for the man and have asked for the public’s help in identifying and locating him. A photo issued by police shows the car that picked up the two subjects after Cooper was shot. Potter County Justice of the Peace Gary L. Jackson ordered an autopsy, which was scheduled for Thursday. Anyone with information is asked to call Special Crimes at 806-378-9468 or Amarillo Crime Stoppers at 806-374-4400.

3032	http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2016/02/man_shot_on_austerltz_street.html	Man shot several times on Austerlitz Street	Man shot several times on Austerlitz StreetA 52-year-old man was shot several times Saturday evening (Feb. 13) in the 800 block of Austerlitz Street, the NOPD said. The man's injuries did not appear to be life threatening, police said. The victim and Will Moffett, 35, "were involved in a verbal altercation when Moffett produced a handgun and shot the victim multiple times," NOPD spokesman Juan Barnes said in a news release. Moffett returned to the location and has been arrested for aggravated battery by shooting, Barnes said. Four police officers surrounded and apprehended Moffett in the middle of the street when he walked back to the scene of the shooting in the East Riverside neighborhood. When the shots rang out, they were loud enough for Chris Otten to hear as he worked in the Billy Reid boutique on Magazine Street. He said he called 911 around 6:51 p.m. as locked the store's doors after hearing six shots. He watched authorities carry the victim on a stretcher to the ambulance from the intersection of Austerlitz and Magazine Street. "Gun violence is really real here," Otten said. "You've heard gunshots, but seeing this? This is terrifying." Otten said he gives the NOPD "kudos" for their quick response. At least three police cars arrived on scene in "under two minutes" after his call, and he said "within five minutes, the block was filled with cops." Residents who live near the scene of the shooting watched as authorities placed Moffet inside of a police van. Authorities continued to interview residents while they questioned a clamorous Moffett. A witness who did not want to be identified for fear of his safety said the shooter "had no business" shooting the victim. Another resident who did not want to be identified for fear of her safety said the victim was talking when authorities arrived. She said she checked the victim and did not see any blood, but had seen "little bitty bullet holes." "He must have shot him with a BB gun," she said. "But the gun was loud, though."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":369,"startIndex":360,"value":"multiple "},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":340,"startIndex":332,"value":"handgun "}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":148,"startIndex":118,"value":"800 block of Austerlitz Street"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":101,"startIndex":93,"value":"evening "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":267,"startIndex":265,"value":"35"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":263,"startIndex":250,"value":" Will Moffett"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":47,"startIndex":45,"value":"52"},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A1CVM8I2566ILI

Rick Thorton, 54, said it is what people do not see in the heavily edited YouTube clip that pushed him over the edge. “I wasn’t taking any chances. He knocked on the window, I was ready for him,” said Thorton. Thorton, who is on a work trip in Henderson, Nevada, said a large group of motorcyclists were driving recklessly, almost hit him and he did not like their actions on the road. “I flipped them off, no doubt about it,” said Thorton. But when the group started to surround his truck, Thorton said he felt threatened. “When I declined his invitation to pull over the first time, that should have been enough,” said Thorton. Fearing for his safety, Thorton yanked out his pistol when he said one of the bikers got too close. The biker who recorded the video has remained anonymous. He runs a YouTube page. The biker said it all started when a rider in his group drove off-road for a moment and had kicked up some dirt. “I didn’t really think it was going escalate to what it did and that’s literally the first time I’ve gone up to somebody’s window in traffic like that and it will be the last,” said the biker. While the biker regrets his actions, Thorton does not. “Don’t walk up to anybody, especially a Texan, and hope they’re not packing,” said Thorton. Police are investigating. Thorton said if he is charged, he will fight it in court. (©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Javoni Patton was shot several times at close range near his car at Stratford and Connecticut avenues near the Stratford border, a few blocks from his home on Elizabeth Street.

Police are asking anyone with information on the homicide to contact Detective Robert Winkler at 203-581-5224. The last homicide in Bridgeport occurred Christmas Eve, when 14-year-old Luis Colon was an innocent bystander in a drug-related shooting.

The investigation also led to burglary charges against two people connected to the case, authorities said Tuesday. The shooting happened as a group of teenagers were riding in a vehicle on Candler Highway near Tanner's Mill Road around 8:00 p.m., according to the Hall County Sheriff's Office. A female front seat passenger suffered a gunshot wound to her back, apparently at the hands of a backseat passenger who was handling the gun. Authorities Tuesday said the firearm was stolen. Sergio Salamanca, 17, was initially charged with reckless conduct in the case, but the charge was dismissed, according to a Tuesday media release from the sheriff's office. "After further investigation, it was determined that another passenger of the vehicle in which the teens were traveling, Sergio Canales-Vasquez (age 17, of Gainesville), was in possession of the firearm at the time it was fired and struck the front seat passenger," Deputy Chad Mann stated in a media release. "Sergio Canales-Vasquez was subsequently charged with reckless conduct, making false statements (Felony) and discharging a handgun near a public highway." Another passenger, Julisa Canales-Vasquez, 18, has been charged with making false statements (felony). Sheriff's Deputy Nicole Bailes earlier said the victim was taken to Northeast Georgia Medical Center where she underwent emergency surgery. "The victim is still receiving treatment for her injury," Mann said Tuesday. The original suspect in the shooting, Salamanca, allegedly jumped from the vehicle before the group flagged down an Oakwood Police Officer for help. Salamanca had been wanted by the Department of Juvenile Justice for escape. He was arrested later Friday evening. Investigators have since recovered the gun from the shooting and said it was stolen during a previous burglary in the county. "Both Sergio Canales-Vasquez and Sergio Salamanca were listed as suspects in that burglary and an additional burglary in Hall County. Vazquez and Salamanca were additionally charged with two counts of burglary, 1st degree," Mann said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":140,"startIndex":133,"value":"Oakwood"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":495,"startIndex":486,"value":"8:00 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-11","details":{"endIndex":479,"oldEnd":478,"oldStart":438,"startIndex":439,"value":"Candler Highway near Tanner's Mill Road "},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":1954,"startIndex":1947,"value":"evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Yes","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1059,"startIndex":1057,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1051,"startIndex":1029,"value":"Sergio Canales-Vasquez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A3SJUKMWZLY8V3
3205	http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/chi-ferguson-shooting-suspect-20150317-story.html	Ferguson police shooting suspect back in court - The Morning Call	Ferguson police shooting suspect back in court - The Morning CallA man accused of shooting two police officers in Ferguson returned to court Tuesday over a claim that St. Louis County police used excessive force during his arrest. A circuit court judge agreed to defense lawyer Jerryl Christmas' request to photograph Jeffrey L. Williams in the courtroom. Online court records indicate prosecutors took their own photos at the brief hearing, which came one day after Williams, 20, made his first appearance in court. Christmas told The Associated Press on Monday that police roughed up his client and described bruises on Williams' back, shoulders and face and a knot on his head. Police spokesman Brian Schellman called the assertion "completely false" while noting that the suspect was seen by a nurse when he was booked into the county jail, standard procedure for all incoming inmates. He added that Williams did not resist arrest. Christmas also suggested that police coerced a statement by Williams in which he reportedly admitted to the shooting but said he wasn't targeting police. Schellman also rejected that assertion, noting the statement was videotaped. Williams, shackled at the waist and feet, was led into a jury room Tuesday, where he was photographed, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported. He was then returned to county lock-up. Christmas said some of the injuries are visible in a police mug shot distributed Sunday, the Post-Dispatch reported. He said red marks can be seen on his client's throat and cheek. Williams is accused of shooting the two officers early Thursday outside Ferguson's police station, which has been the scene of protests since last summer's fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Williams was arrested Sunday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense. In his interview with the AP on Monday, Christmas countered an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting. "This wasn't any type of ambush shooting," Christmas said. "Those officers were shot accidentally." Christmas later said in other media interviews that Williams didn't fire the shots at the officers. He did not respond to several messages Tuesday seeking to clarify the discrepancy. Police have said Williams told investigators he was aiming instead at someone with whom he had a dispute. But that assertion was met with skepticism by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch. "We're not sure we completely buy that part of it," the prosecutor said Sunday. Christmas told the AP he wasn't aware of any details regarding a possible dispute that could have preceded the shooting. The shooting happened as a demonstration began to break up. The protest followed the resignation of city Police Chief Tom Jackson in the wake of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the city's police practices. Williams is jailed on $300,000 bond. The Ferguson Police Department has been a national focal point since Brown, who was black and unarmed, was killed by police officer Darren Wilson, who is white. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and Wilson was cleared of civil rights charges by a Justice Department report released March 4. Wilson resigned in November. A separate Justice Department report found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":122,"startIndex":114,"value":"Ferguson"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-12","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":479,"startIndex":477,"value":"20"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":337,"startIndex":318,"value":"Jeffrey L.

3211	http://abc11.com/news/raleigh-police-investigating-shooting/1191560/	Taxi driver killed in Raleigh shooting | abc11.com	Taxi driver killed in Raleigh shooting | abc11.comAbout 1:20 a.m., officers were called to the Hodges Creek Apartments in the 2000 block of Hodge Creek Drive, off Old Wake Forest Road. When they arrived, they found 55-year-old Jose Nicolas Dominguez of Raleigh shot to death. Authorities said he had been a driver for Amigo Taxi for the past seven years and was on duty at the time. On Monday night, all police could tell ABC11 is that they suspect there was more than one person involved. Police also have reason to think the suspects fled in a white car. It's not much to go on, but those who knew Dominguez hope it turns up something. His coworkers told ABC11 that they believe he was robbed and assaulted. "He was a great coworker," Amigo taxi driver Joaquin Loyola said. "I still can't believe what happened to him. We're told they wanted to assault him or rob him." Loyola said Dominguez was responding to a call for pick up early this morning. He said it is a very dangerous job, especially at night - adding they've both worked overnight shifts and people try to stiff them of cab fares or assault or berate them. Loyola said he himself was held up at gunpoint 6 months ago. "Things happen all the time," he said. Loyola also said that drivers have radios to call for emergencies, but Dominguez never flagged an emergency. Authorities have not confirmed whether Dominguez was robbed, saying they can't discuss specifics about the case. Authorities did say a preliminary investigation revealed that multiple suspects were involved in the crime. Descriptions of the suspects are not available at this point, but police said the suspects were thought to have fled the scene in a white car. Neighbors told ABC11 that officers have been going door to door Monday, asking for what they saw or heard. "Three o'clock this morning there was banging on my door and its the police, asking if I heard anything," said resident Andrea Tyler. She said she was surprised she didn't hear anything, especially gunshots. So for now, exactly what happened here at Hodges Creek remains a mystery. Loyola just knows he lost a friend; one he described as charismatic, happy and always friendly.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":29,"startIndex":22,"value":"Raleigh"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":64,"startIndex":55,"value":" 1:20 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-08","details":{"endIndex":118,"startIndex":95,"value":"Hodges Creek Apartments"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":1830,"startIndex":1822,"value":"morning "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":226,"startIndex":215,"value":"55-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":249,"startIndex":227,"value":"Jose Nicolas Dominguez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3F7XWCTV8DCVH
3215	http://gawker.com/nearly-1-000-people-were-fatally-shot-by-police-in-2015-1749837469	Nearly 1,000 People Were Fatally Shot by Police in 2015	Nearly 1,000 People Were Fatally Shot by Police in 2015A total of 965 people fell dead this year after hearing the blast of a gun that belonged to a police officer. This statistic was gleaned from records of every fatal police shooting in the nation in 2015—a number that until now had never been calculated. The Washington Post concluded a year-long study on Sunday, publishing a comprehensive breakdown of the state of fatal police shootings, from ones involving both armed and unarmed victims. The report reads: The Washington Post found that the kind of incidents that have ignited protests in many U.S. communities — most often, white police officers killing unarmed black men — represent less than 4 percent of fatal police shootings. Meanwhile, The Post found that the great majority of people who died at the hands of the police fit at least one of three categories: they were wielding weapons, they were suicidal or mentally troubled, or they ran when officers told them to halt. More specifically, the report made some noteworthy findings regarding the identities of the victims. Some 40 percent of the unarmed men shot to by police this year were black—despite the fact that black men make up just 6 percent of the country. A disproportionately high number of men who were killed without exhibiting threatening behavior were black or Hispanic. The names of many of those killed by police have incited protests across the U.S. this year and the one before it—yet the shootings continue to happen.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Two male suspects were seen fleeing in an unknown vehicle after the shooting in the 300 block of Holly Avenue near San Marcus Street at about 7 p.m., according to the Compton Sheriff's Station. Deputies said the girl was in a crib inside the home when the suspects opened fire into the garage, which was a converted apartment. Multiple witnesses told ABC7 they heard 10 to 12 shots. After the child was shot, officials said the girl's father grabbed her and ran outside where deputies located them. The child was taken with her father to Saint Francis Medical Center, where she later died. The sheriff's department said the shooting appeared to be gang related. Deputies originally stated the child was 3-months-old, but have since said she had just turned one.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":575,"startIndex":567,"value":"10 to 12"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":148,"startIndex":141,"value":"Compton"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":348,"startIndex":336,"value":"about 7 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":332,"startIndex":277,"value":"in the 300 block of Holly Avenue near San Marcus Street"},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":84,"startIndex":83,"value":"1"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A1VEXF7BDDZIMI

Law enforcement officials responded to a domestic dispute in North Fargo, where a suspect was barricaded inside a home and had been firing shots at officers who responded to the scene. Fargo Deputy Police Chief Joe Anderson told the Associated Press the incident began around 7 p.m. Wednesday. A caller told dispatchers his father had possibly fired a gun at his mother. Anderson said the caller and the suspect's wife were able to leave the home unharmed. The suspect then began to fire multiple rounds out of the house. One of these rounds allegedly struck 33-year-old officer Jason Moszer. He was taken to a medical facility with his family. Moszer is not expected to survive, the AP reported. The standoff is ongoing and residents have been told to stay indoors. Anderson said authorities have not made contact with the suspect.

Mark Ramirez, 31, died at a local hospital a short time after he was shot by the officer, said Lt. Erick Bohannon, coordinator of the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit. Bohannon did not identify the officer who shot Ramirez. Other officers who responded to the call were also placed on administrative leave Sunday in accordance with Amarillo Police Department policy. Police did not say whether more than one officer fired at Ramirez, citing the ongoing investigation. At 10:22 a.m. Sunday, officers were dispatched to 833 S. Travis St. in reference to a report of a suicidal person, later identified as Ramirez. Callers told police Ramirez either had access to or was in possession of a gun. When officers arrived outside the house, Ramirez opened the front door and began to move a gun in the direction of the officers, police said. An officer shot Ramirez and after he dropped to the ground officers administered first aid and requested an ambulance. Ramirez was taken to a local hospital where he later died. Potter County Justice of the Peace Richard Herman has ordered an autopsy scheduled to be performed Tuesday morning in Lubbock, Bohannon said. Police taped off the house and blocked traffic to the block for several hours Sunday while the Special Crimes Unit investigated the shooting. Orange spray paint marked evidence found in the street in front of the house. Neighbors declined to comment on the incident. The Special Crimes Unit is asking anyone with information about this case to call 806-378-9468.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":60,"startIndex":52,"value":"Amarillo"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":736,"startIndex":726,"value":"10:22 a.m."},"date":"2016-03-13","details":{"endIndex":251,"startIndex":218,"value":" 800 block of South Travis Street"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":211,"startIndex":204,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":269,"startIndex":267,"value":"31"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":265,"startIndex":253,"value":"Mark Ramirez"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A1ENHFQSXOXG6I

(AP) — The latest on the fatal shooting of a police officer during a standoff at a home in Fargo, North Dakota (all times local): 9:30 p.m. About 200 people have gathered in Fargo for a vigil to honor a city police officer fatally shot in the line of duty. KFGO-AM reports (http://bit.ly/1WhaI0q ) the group held candles and prayed as they gathered outside a hospital Thursday night. Police officials said 33-year-old Officer Jason Moszer died hours earlier of a single gunshot wound. He was struck while responding to a domestic violence report at a home in Fargo Wednesday evening. Moorhead Police Officer Nicole Reno says Moszer "lived life to the fullest." Reno says he "was just really a great officer." Moszer was a six-year veteran of the department. 5:15 p.m. The man suspected of fatally shooting a Fargo police officer was sent to prison for a 1988 shooting that killed a man. Forty-nine-year-old Marcus Schumacher is accused of shooting Officer Jason Moszer after the six-year veteran of the force answered a call Wednesday evening about a domestic disturbance. Court records show Schumacher was sentenced in 1989 on charges of manslaughter and reckless endangerment for the death in downtown Grand Forks of 17-year-old Maynard Clauthier. The North Dakota Supreme Court ordered a new trial the following year and Schumacher was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years. Separate court documents show that Schumacher was convicted of disorderly conduct in January 2013.

Fargo Deputy Police Chief Joe Anderson says 33-year-old Officer Jason Moszer responded to the standoff Wednesday night and parked near a home the suspect was barricaded inside. Anderson says the suspect fired multiple rounds from inside the home and struck Moszer. A SWAT team took Moszer to a medical facility, where his family was with him. Anderson says the six-year veteran of the force is "not expected to survive." Authorities have checked on nearby residents and don't believe anyone else is injured. The incident began around 7 p.m. after a report that the suspect had fired a gun at his family. The standoff is ongoing. Anderson says authorities haven't made contact with the suspect. 2 a.m. Authorities say a suspect in a domestic dispute is barricaded inside a home in north Fargo and has been firing shots amid a standoff with officers. Multiple law enforcement agencies responded Wednesday night, and dozens of officers set up a perimeter. Fargo Deputy Police Chief Joe Anderson says the incident began around 7 p.m. when a caller told dispatchers his father had possibly fired a gun at his mother. Anderson says the caller and the suspect's wife were able to leave the home unharmed. The suspect then began to fire multiple rounds out of the house. A SWAT team was activated. Nearby residents were asked to stay inside. Anderson said just before 2 a.m. the standoff was ongoing and officials are considering using robots to attempt to contact the suspect.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":3413,"startIndex":3405,"value":"multiple"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":94,"startIndex":89,"value":"FARGO"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":239,"startIndex":231,"value":"9:30 p.m"},"date":"2016-02-10","details":{"endIndex":666,"startIndex":650,"value":"a home in Fargo "},"state":"ND - North Dakota","time-day":{"endIndex":5391,"startIndex":5386,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":2042,"startIndex":2040,"value":"49"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":2070,"startIndex":2052,"value":"Marcus Schumacher "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1742,"startIndex":1740,"value":"33"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1773,"startIndex":1760,"value":"Jason Moszer "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":2042,"startIndex":2040,"value":"49"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":2070,"startIndex":2052,"value":"Marcus Schumacher "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

3414	http://blogs.rollcall.com/news/rift-guns-threatens-mental-health-package/	Rift Over Guns Threatens Mental Health Package	Rift Over Guns Threatens Mental Health PackageSenators are continuing to negotiate a mental health system overhaul package, but one issue threatens its future: guns. "I think there’s a chance for a big, bipartisan mental health reform bill in the Senate this year," Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn, said Wednesday. "I think that’s unlikely to happen if there are gun provisions on the floor." Murphy said senators were working to craft a sweeping mental health bill that would be based on legislation drafted by him and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and include a few other measures. The hope, he said, is to get it out of committee and bring it up at the same time as Sen. John Cornyn's bill, which addresses the link between the mental health and criminal justice systems. "We’re hoping to get that negotiation wrapped up in weeks, not months, so that our bill could come to the floor at the same time as the Cornyn bill," Murphy said. But some provisions in Cornyn's bill relating to firearms could threaten the fate of the package, which became clear at a Senate Judiciary hearing Wednesday. The hearing focused mainly on the links between the mental health system and the criminal justice system, which witnesses characterized as a "revolving door." But a brief exchange between two top senators revealed that the gun provisions could cause partisan divides. Currently, anyone who has been found by a court or lawful authority to have a mental illness and be a danger to oneself or others, or has been committed to a mental institution, is barred from possessing a firearm. In 2014, the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System, or NICS, issued more than 3,500 firearm denials due to "adjudicated mental health," which were a fraction of the nearly 91,000 total denials. The provisions in Cornyn's bill would set up an administrative review process for someone who is barred from obtaining a firearm due to mental illness, and set conditions to remove records from a federal background check system. "In fact, some of the provisions in Senator Cornyn’s bill would make it easier, not harder, for mentally ill individuals to access firearms," Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said. "That is the opposite direction from which we should be moving.” The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence president blasted Cornyn's bill as "two-faced" and "dangerous" in a press release Wednesday. "Nothing in my legislation makes it easier for mentally ill people to get access to firearms," Cornyn, responded at the hearing. "Nothing.” Cornyn later told reporters that Schumer "completely mischaracterized" his legislation, arguing that his bill provides due process and requires that there be evidence someone has a "disqualifying mental illness" before they are barred from obtaining a gun. Cornyn demurred on whether the disagreement over the firearm provisions could endanger his effort to combine his bill with other mental health legislation, and threaten the the broader effort to overhaul the mental health system. "I recognize that that’s a point of difference, and we need to have a conversation about how serious everyone is about getting something done," Cornyn said. "I certainly would like to get something done.” He could face some resistance from Rep. Tim Murphy, the Pennsylvania Republican who is the architect of the comprehensive mental health system legislation in the House. Rep. Murphy said Wednesday that he did not know the exact wording of the provisions in Cornyn's bill, but was wary of incorporating any language about guns into the package. "As soon as we start adding things to them about guns and weapons, etc., it changes the whole tone of what we’re trying to do,” he said. "I just get worried we confuse them with a lot of other issues that would derail our efforts to take away the stigma of dealing with the actual disease." The House Republican said he and Cornyn discussed their bills at the joint GOP retreat in Baltimore in January, and that he was due to talk with Cornyn again, as Rep. Murphy is currently in the process of looking at language of other bills and proposals to incorporate into a broader bill. Murphy, a clinical psychologist, did acknowledge a connection between the criminal justice and mental health systems, but said they didn't necessarily need to be addressed in the same piece of legislation. The connection between the two systems was evident at the Wednesday hearing, where witnesses pointed to the high numbers of incarcerated individuals with mental illness, and stressed the need for proper treatment for those suffering and crisis intervention training for law enforcement. A focus on officer training and multi-departmental coordination on mental health efforts in Texas was touted at the hearing as a potential model for other jurisdictions. "This is an issue that affects everyone,” Bexar County Sheriff Susan L. Pamerleau told senators, explaining that her brother was mentally illl. She added, "Jails are not the place for those suffering from mental illness.” Niels Lesniewski contributed to this report.

3488	http://cinemablaze.com/2016/02/12/fargo-officer-shot-not-expected-to-survive.html	Fargo Officer Shot, Not Expected to Survive	Fargo Officer Shot, Not Expected to SurviveSioux Falls Police Officers are wearing a special mourning badge today in honor of Officer Jason Moszner. Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said in a statement the city was "profoundly saddened" by the death of Moszer, who won a Silver Star commendation after he and another officer were credited with risking their lives in 2011 to rescue two children from an apartment fire. Fargo's Police Chief said 33-year-old Jason Moszer has a wound that is "non-survivable". "He is not expected to survive", Anderson said. The man suspected of fatally shooting a Fargo police officer was sent to prison for a 1988 shooting that killed a man. Two Cass County sheriff's deputies secure an area in North Fargo, N.D., on Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 one block from a house where a suspect is accused of shooting a police officer. Police officer Jason Moszer, 33, was wounded on Wednesday evening when he responded to a domestic disturbance on the northeast side of Fargo, North Dakota, according to WDAZ, an ABC affiliate. The suspect's name has not yet been released. Even after the gunman was dead, investigators had several blocks sealed off - no one in, no one out - as they scoured the area collecting evidence and interviewing residents. Authorities were not sure of his identity, Anderson said. "Just to let people know that we're thinking about that officer that we're supporting them, and it's really a sign of respect for that officer and the job that he did", says Officer Clemens. Family members visited him in a hospital earlier in the day to say goodbye, Fargo Police Chief David Todd said. A standoff ensued overnight and when the firing stopped, police discovered Schumacher dead inside the home. Todd did not identify the suspect and said it was too soon to tell whether he was felled by police bullets - or if he took his own life during the 11-hour standoff. Moszer is the second Fargo officer to die in the line of duty. This undated photo released by Fargo Police Department shows Fargo police officer Jason Moszer. Police didn't immediately give an update on the man who has barricaded himself inside the home since Wednesday evening. Police said the suspect fired multiple rounds from inside the home, seriously injuring Moszer. Police do not believe anyone else has been injured. A SWAT team in an armored vehicle retrieved Moszer and took him to a hospital. The incident began around 7 p.m. after a report that the suspect had fired a gun at his wife. The caller and his mother were able to escape the home unharmed, Anderson said. Police say a suspect in the shooting of a North Dakota police officer has been found shot to death in the home where he barricaded himself for about 11 hours. She said she and her girlfriend locked the doors, turned off the lights and hunkered down in the basement for the night.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":6,"startIndex":0,"value":"Fargo "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-11","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"ND - North Dakota","time-day":{"endIndex":910,"startIndex":903,"value":"evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":876,"startIndex":874,"value":"33"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":147,"startIndex":134,"value":"Jason Moszner"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A1CVM8I2566ILI
3501	http://cjonline.com/opinion/2016-02-04/editorial-bb-gun-and-air-rifle-school-events-are-ok	Editorial: BB gun and air rifle school events are OK | CJOnline.com	Editorial: BB gun and air rifle school events are OK | CJOnline.comA recent bill introduced in a Kansas House committee to remove a ban on use of school property for air-gun shooting events makes sense. Such events should be held at the discretion of local school districts, which can then impose safety guidelines they deem necessary for conducting competitions. The bill, introduced by Rep. Blake Carpenter, R-Derby, would enable schools to conduct BB gun, air rifle and air pistol tournaments. The move stemmed from an incident in Carpenter’s district, where the Derby BB Gun Club was prohibited from using a local elementary school after state law was cited that led to the club’s ouster. The club had used that particular school facility for about 30 years without incident. Obviously, school administrators should meet with club organizers and stress the importance of safety measures. Students would be prohibited from having contact with such guns except during hours practice and competition is authorized, when class isn’t in session. Such procedures may require club organizers to be responsible for bringing such guns into the building with the supervision of an administrator. In addition, practices and competition must be conducted with strict supervision. This is the very essence of gun safety. Allowing students a chance to participate in clubs enables them, as Carpenter mentioned, to learn skills and sportsmanship. Much like kids who involve themselves in other sports, practices arranged at local schools often allow for more participation and camaraderie. The sport of rifle is actually sanctioned at the NCAA level. One local standout, Caitlin Morrissey, was an honors graduate from Topeka West High School who became a scholarship recruit on the TCU rifle team from 2009-13. She earned All-America honors as a shooter in both the air rifle and smallbore divisions. If local schools agree to allow their facilities to be used for such practice and competition, state law shouldn’t prohibit the willingness of local boards and schools to adopt measures for such events. The bill introduced in the Kansas House also requires participants in shooting events to sign waivers of liability to relieve the school district and district personnel of liability. Passage of this measure would put opportunities to conduct shooting competitions at the discretion of local school administrators. After what happened to block the club from Derby, local schools should be allowed to decide whether such competition should be permissible. While this does seem like a good bill as described in this article, the bill does not give local districts discretion. Schools will have to allow these no matter what. I know Washburn Rural doesn't allow indoor softball and baseball practices because their newer facilities could get damaged, at a cost to the taxpayer. This bill would require them to allow BB guns in these same places. I've read the bill. It basically says that a school district cannot prohibit an organization from using their property SOLEY on the basis that air guns would be used. This does not mandate that a school district has to allow the organization to use the property nor does it prohibit a school district from imposing additional requirements (with the exception that they cannot require liability insurance) if the property is to be used. Having said that, I agree it is not a good bill. We have school districts subsidizing the parents more and more, why should districts have to subsidize organizations as well? Just because an organization can rent a school cheaper than other locations does not mean that organization is entitled to use the school. I think it is better to keep the ban on outside individuals use of weapons on the school premises, but change the bill to allow the school districts, at their own choice, to hold such air gun training as such would be in line with the mandate of education that schools have. If school districts do not want to do this, then private groups could provide such training but would have to find accommodations someplace other than the school. While I have never laid eyes on one of these look alike air guns, the images on the internet are enough to be concerning. Given the sophistication of todays air guns and the fact people in Kansas can conceal carry without a permit I hope the legislature gets this right. If not, this could result in a tragedy. All had air rifles that were used. Each shooter had an adult the inserted a bb into the barrel end of the gun ad used a thin rod to seat the bb properly. When this process was completed, the rifle was given to the shooter for his use. The back stop was very heavy blankets which cause the spent bb to drop straight down with no danger posed to anyone in the area.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

The sheriff's office identified the deceased shooting victim as Calvin Nunies Jr., 41. The shooting happened about 3:30 p.m. Friday at 1114 S.E. 93rd in Wakarusa. At that time, crime scene tape was draped across S.E. 93rd, and traffic on that road was blocked in both directions. Nunies was transported with life-threatening wounds to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. “A preliminary investigation indicates an acquaintance of Mr. Nunies was the shooter,” according to a statement issued by the sheriff’s office about 2:30 p.m. Saturday. “The acquaintance has been interviewed by the sheriff’s office.” The name of the acquaintance wasn’t specified, and the statement wasn’t clear whether that person was arrested. The statement also didn’t say whether the shooting was being investigated as an offense or an accident. The sheriff’s office and the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office are examining the circumstances of the shooting. American Medical Response ambulance, the Shawnee Heights Fire Department and the State Fire Marshal’s Office assisted at the shooting site. The sheriff’s office asked anyone with information about the shooting to contact either detectives at 251-2251 or the Crime Stoppers tip line at 234-0007. I noticed the dichotomy between the heading and the withholding of the name, too. If they KNOW he was shot by an acquaintance as the heading says, then they know who that acquaintance is. My guess is the headline was too confident of the outcome. Perhaps the sheriff did say that to the reporter, but in not releasing the guy's name (or gal's) he shows he has not proven that yet.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":396,"startIndex":388,"value":"Wakarusa"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":359,"startIndex":350,"value":"3:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-25","details":{"endIndex":384,"startIndex":370,"value":"1114 S.E. 93rd"},"state":"KS - Kansas","time-day":{"endIndex":233,"startIndex":224,"value":"afternoon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":318,"value":"41"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":316,"startIndex":299,"value":"Calvin Nunies Jr."},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A142ZRU284W9O
3525	http://fox61.com/2016/02/11/meriden-man-pleads-guilty-to-shooting-at-mosque/	Meriden man pleads guilty to shooting at mosque | FOX 61	Meriden man pleads guilty to shooting at mosque | FOX 61HARTFORD — A Meriden man pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime for shooting at a mosque next to his home shortly after the deadly attacks in Paris. Ted Hakey Jr., 48, pleaded guilty Thursday afternoon in federal court in Hartford to damaging religious property with a dangerous weapon. “A core mission of the Justice Department is to protect every person against racially, religiously and ethnically motivated violence and intimidation,” said U.S. Attorney Dierdre Daly. “Individuals who commit hateful, divisive and violent acts against others in violation of federal law will be prosecuted. All of us have a right to worship freely and without fear of violence.” Authorities say the mosque was empty and no one was hurt when Hakey shot at Baitul Aman Mosque in Meriden with a rifle shortly after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. Four bullets struck the mosque. The investigation revealed that after Hakey heard about the Paris attacks he posted on Facebook: “What is gonna be the breaking point to go ‘weapons free’ against Islam?” Weapons free is a military term that means shoot at will.

Lanier, who said he thought the gun wasn't loaded, was struck in the leg. He told police he "heard boom, saw smoke and felt a burning in his leg." Sebring Police Cmdr. Steve Carr said Lanier was not seriously injured. Carr also noted that he had never come across a case like this before, but somehow neglected to work in something about every dog having their day.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":340,"startIndex":330,"value":"9mm pistol"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":544,"startIndex":536,"value":"Sebring "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":306,"startIndex":287,"value":"State Road 17 North"},"state":"FL - Florida","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":317,"value":"dog"},"race":{"endIndex":320,"startIndex":317,"value":"dog"}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":208,"startIndex":206,"value":"35"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":237,"startIndex":218,"value":"Gregory Dale Lanier"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A1FGKIKJYSL1MI

The incident was reported about 2:15 a.m. Friday at L.R. “Dad” Perry Park, near Harvard and Monterey Way in Lawrence. Authorities said the shooting occurred following a verbal altercation between the suspect and victim, who knew each other. Police Sgt. Trent McKinley said officers responding to the call located the victim, who had been shot multiple times. Douglas County District Attorney Charles Branson’s office on Friday afternoon identified the victim as Anthony Wisdom. Medical responders treated Wisdom at the scene. He was then taken by air ambulance to Stormont-Vail Regional Health Center in Topeka. McKinley said Lawrence police were able to obtain information from Wisdom regarding the shooter’s identity and a description of the vehicle in which the suspect left. Just before 3 a.m., officers located the suspect, identified as JD Turner, of Lawrence, and the vehicle on 23rd Street just west of Harper in East Lawrence. Officers initiated a car stop at that location. Turner was taken into custody without incident, McKinley said. After being interviewed at Lawrence police headquarters, Turner was arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail. Branson’s office said Turner’s bond was set at $250,000. His next court appearance will be at 2 p.m. Feb. 19. According to Kansas Department of Corrections records, Turner was convicted twice in Douglas County — in 2000 and 2006 — for possession of opiates or narcotics. The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office on Friday morning rejected a request for Turner’s mugshot, citing a provision of the Kansas Open Records Act allowing agencies to withhold information that would “interfere with any prospective law enforcement action, criminal investigation or prosecution.” The Topeka Capital-Journal later obtained his mugshot from the Kansas Department of Corrections’ website.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":84,"startIndex":75,"value":"Lawrence "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":313,"startIndex":304,"value":"2:15 a.m."},"date":"2016-03-25","details":{"endIndex":345,"startIndex":324,"value":"L.R. \u201cDad\u201d Perry Park"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":202,"startIndex":194,"value":"morning "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":102,"startIndex":100,"value":"34"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1124,"startIndex":1115,"value":"JD Turner"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["hospitalized"]}]}	A1CVM8I2566ILI

Shawnee County Jail records indicated Royelle Lamont Miller, 35, of Topeka, was booked into the jail at 2:01 p.m. in connection with one felony count each of an aggravated weapons violation by a convicted felon and interference with a law enforcement officer involving obstruction or resistance in a felony case. Miller sustained injuries that weren’t considered life-threatening about 9:35 p.m. Friday when shots were fired at 3300 S.E. Humboldt, Topeka police said. A weapon was found on the property by a police dog and collected as evidence, said Lt. Colleen Stuart. Police then arrested Miller at the hospital when he was discharged, she said. Police arrested Ralfeal L. Carr, 35, of Topeka, in connection with crimes linked to Friday’s shooting that included one felony count each of aggravated battery, an aggravated weapons violation and shooting at an unoccupied dwelling. Carr’s Facebook page at http://cjon.co/1HFezhX identifies him as CEO and co-founder of Topeka-based Underworld Music Group/Universal Music Group. Kansas Department of Corrections records indicated Miller served a prison term that expired in May. Those records said he has convictions for fleeing or attempting to elude police in 2012 in Shawnee County, a drug crime committed in 2006 in Lyon County and an aggravated battery committed in 1996 in Shawnee County. Miller was prosecuted as an adult despite being 16 years old at the time of the aggravated battery, in which — as an inmate at the Youth Center at Topeka — he beat a youth services worker over the head with a fire extinguisher, seriously injuring him, Topeka Capital-Journal archives show. Those archives also show: ■ Miller was indicted by a Shawnee County District Court grant jury on a first-degree murder charge in the April 2006 shooting death of Andre Douglas, 26, in an alley in Central Topeka. Then-District Attorney Robert Hecht’s office dismissed the charge in April 2007, three days before Miller was to go to trial. ■ Miller was 13 when he suffered an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound while sitting in the audience at a February 1994 talent contest inside White Concert Hall, 1701 S.W. Jewell Ave. A scumbag looking for payback against other scumbags. It is very unfortunate that a 5 year old girl died because of this war between scumbags. It would suit me just fine if all the scumbags in this neighborhood killed each other as long as they could shoot straight and not kill innocents. The police lock them up and the courts let them go with light sentences. Put them all on an island with a tall retaining wall and give them all weapons. Last man standing gets the death sentence. Good job TPD picking this dirtbag up. Hope the courts don't take it lightly.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":144,"startIndex":138,"value":"Topeka"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":707,"startIndex":698,"value":"9:35 p.m."},"date":"2016-03-25","details":{"endIndex":758,"startIndex":740,"value":"3300 S.E.

Their identities have not been released by the Hennepin County medical examiner’s office. Authorities said at a news conference Saturday they believe the woman was a victim of domestic violence. It appears she and the suspect had been living together, according to officials. Law enforcement officials told KSTP that Perry – the suspected shooter – and Nelson were “cohabitants,” while a local attorney described them as a couple who were engaged, the Star Tribune reports. The incident started around 9:14 p.m. Friday near the intersection of County Road 9 and Northwest Boulevard in Plymouth, where police found a woman with a gunshot wound dead, Plymouth Police Chief Mike Goldstein said on Saturday, according to KARE 11. About four minutes later, Perry was reported at an apartment complex about 2 miles away where the shootout took place. It’s not clear if the man, who was described as having a violent past, died due to officers’ gunshots, Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said at a news conference Saturday. According to Stanek, the suspect had a long gun and a hand gun and had been wearing a “tactical” vest, loaded with magazines. The suspect was a prohibited person who should not have had access to firearms, the sheriff noted. Officials will investigate how the man got the weapons.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":944,"oldEnd":943,"oldStart":935,"startIndex":936,"value":"Plymouth"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":862,"oldEnd":861,"oldStart":852,"startIndex":853,"value":"9:14 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-14","details":{"endIndex":932,"oldEnd":931,"oldStart":878,"startIndex":879,"value":"intersection of County Road 9 and Northwest Boulevard"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":278,"oldEnd":277,"oldStart":266,"startIndex":267,"value":"28-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":291,"oldEnd":290,"oldStart":279,"startIndex":280,"value":"Corey Perry"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":278,"oldEnd":277,"oldStart":266,"startIndex":267,"value":"28-year-old"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":309,"oldEnd":308,"oldStart":295,"startIndex":296,"value":"Trisha Nelson"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":278,"oldEnd":277,"oldStart":266,"startIndex":267,"value":"28-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":291,"oldEnd":290,"oldStart":279,"startIndex":280,"value":"Corey Perry"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AOIR8V07FYMH5

Officers were called to the high school at 13719 Harmony Rd. about 11:20 a.m. after a single bullet was found in the hallway near the Performing Arts Center, which was in use by the Willow Creek Church at the time, according to a statement from the Huntley Police Department. A church attendee turned the bullet over to church personnel.

The 48-year-old woman was located sitting alone in her vehicle at Augustana Lutheran Church, in Midway Township around 10:50 p.m. Thursday, according to a release from the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office. Officers had been called to the scene on a report of a woman with a gun who was threatening to take her own life, the release says. While at the scene, the sheriff’s office says the woman got out of her vehicle and “threatened law enforcement officers with a firearm.” Her exact actions are not described in any more detail. At that point two officers on the scene fired their weapons, and the woman sustained two gunshot wounds, according to the release. She was taken to a hospital in Duluth, where she was listed in critical condition. On Facebook, the church responded to a comment about the incident saying: “It’s under control. Prayers are always good.” The shooting is under investigation by the St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office, as well as the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the latter of which will release more information once the investigation is complete.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":807,"oldEnd":806,"oldStart":803,"startIndex":804,"value":"two"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":298,"oldEnd":297,"oldStart":282,"startIndex":283,"value":"Midway Township"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":315,"oldEnd":314,"oldStart":305,"startIndex":306,"value":"10:50 p.m"},"date":"2016-02-12","details":{"endIndex":278,"oldEnd":277,"oldStart":252,"startIndex":253,"value":"Augustana Lutheran Church"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":193,"oldEnd":192,"oldStart":190,"startIndex":191,"value":"48"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":95,"oldEnd":94,"oldStart":87,"startIndex":88,"value":"Cloquet"},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A1IN5BCUGDUFRW
3668	http://finance.yahoo.com/news/police-shooting-phoenix-area-school-murder-suicide-041454680.html	Police: Shooting at Phoenix-area school was a murder-suicide - Yahoo Finance	Police: Shooting at Phoenix-area school was a murder-suicide - Yahoo FinanceGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A shooting at a suburban Phoenix high school that killed two 15-year-old girls and caused panic among parents was a murder-suicide, police said. Police announced that a suicide note was found at the scene of the shooting Friday morning near the cafeteria area of Independence High School in Glendale. They said the girls each were shot once, were declared dead at the scene and a weapon was found near the bodies. "Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appeared to also be in a relationship," Glendale police spokeswoman Tracey Breeden said in a statement Friday afternoon. It is believed nobody witnessed the shooting, Breeden said. Both teens have been identified, but Breeden said "their names will not be confirmed or released at this time by the police department due to their juvenile status." Hours before the lockdown of the school was lifted, hundreds of worried parents crowded the parking lots of nearby discount and convenience stores. One woman gnawed on her fingernails as she spoke on a cellphone, while another had tears streaming down her face. Other parents chain-smoked as they waited for news. Cheryl Rice said she went to a store after a friend called about the shooting and asked about Rice's 15-year-old daughter. But the girl called to say she was safe as Rice arrived at the store. She said it was horrible waiting for word about her child. "You don't know if it's your daughter or not. You don't know who's being bullied. You don't know who is being picked on. You don't know anything. It could be anybody," Rice said. Lanie Walter, who is a senior at the school, heard ambulances on her way to campus but didn't think much of it until her first class was locked down. When she called her parents to tell them she was safe, "my mom was actually really relieved because she was watching it on the news," she said. Parents were bused to the school to be reunited with their children. Some cut through a nearby field as they rushed toward their kids in emotional reunions. Other students who got permission from their parents left campus on their own. The Glendale Union High School District alerted parents to the shooting through emails and automatic phone calls and released information on social media, Superintendent Brian Capistran said. Students typically are not allowed to use their cellphones during lockdowns, but as calls from parents flooded the district, officials asked teachers to have students call family, Capistran said. Social workers and counselors will be available to students and staff when school resumes Tuesday, the superintendent said. Minnie Kramer, mother of a 15-year-old student, said she rushed out of work when she got a text from her son right after the shooting, telling her that he was OK. As she waited to be reunited with her son, Kramer said she worried about whether any of his friends were harmed. "I know that my son is OK, but, emotionally, you don't know what it does, especially at 15, especially if it's someone he knew," Kramer said.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials said the gunman got out of a car, walked up to the residence and fired in the direction of a converted garage where Autumn Johnson, who had just celebrated her birthday last week, lived with her parents. Autumn was struck in the head. One witness, who declined to give her full name, described hearing several gunshots followed by a woman screaming: “They shot my baby. They shot my baby.” The witness said she called 911 before walking outside, where she saw the baby's sobbing father emerge from the garage with his daughter in his arms. “Someone take my baby to the hospital,” the father said. Deputies who responded to the home near Holly Avenue and San Marcus Street took Autumn to St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood in their patrol car, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Ulysses Cruz said. She was pronounced dead at the hospital. (Authorites initially reported Autumn was 3 months old but later said she was 1). The Homicide Report: A story for every victim>> Detectives were trying to determine what prompted the shooting and whether it was related to a gang dispute, said Cmdr. Rod Kusch, who heads the sheriff's Major Crimes Bureau. Sheriff's homicide Capt. Steve Katz described the family of the girl as “very distraught.” “Emotions are very high,” he said. Rena Burleson said she used to watch Autumn and raced to the hospital when she heard about the shooting on social media. Burleson said when she got there the family was gone so she came to the block where they live “to see if it's true, and I see that it's all blocked off.” “It just hurts and bleeds,” said the Long Beach resident. The girl's death quickly reverberated across the neighborhood. Audric Crenshaw, 47, of Carson was in Bible study at a church about two blocks from the shooting. About a dozen other people were in the weekly class at Kingdom Life Christian Fellowship. Crenshaw didn't hear the gunfire but later learned of the girl's death. “It's not surprising because it's the city of Compton, for its name,” Crenshaw said with a sigh as he locked the doors of the stucco-walled church. “But it's surprising to me because it's a baby.” He said the proximity to violence did not make him fearful. “I put my faith in God, not what's in the streets.” See the most-read stories this hour >> Young children have been innocent victims of gang violence before. In 2012, a 15-year-old gang member rode up on a bicycle to a family gathered outside a home in Watts. He drew a revolver and opened fire, killing 14-month-old Angel Mauro Cortez Vega and wounding his 21-year-old father. The assailant, Donald Ray Dokins, mistakenly believed the father was a member of a rival gang because of the color of his T-shirt. Dokins was later convicted of murder and sentenced to 90 years to life in prison. The site of Tuesday's shooting, about a block from Roosevelt Elementary School, is one of the more violent neighborhoods in L.A. County, according to crime data compiled by The Times. During the last six months, Compton has had 475 violent crimes, including eight homicides, according to The Times' database. The city contracts with the Sheriff's Department for police services. After Tuesday night's shooting, authorities said the gunman got into a dark-colored sedan and drove away south on Holly.

(AP) - The Latest on a police shooting in Baton Rouge (all times local): 11:45 a.m. A Baton Rouge woman says the man accused of sparking a gun battle with police was hospitalized in Shreveport several months ago after a suicide attempt. Gina Chambers of Baton Rouge says 22-year-old Calvin Smith is the man whom police say shot two officers Saturday morning following a 2-mile vehicle chase. Chambers says Smith, the godson of her mother, has been living with her since December. Chambers says Smith attempted suicide several months ago while living in Shreveport and was hospitalized there. He had been taking medication; Chambers says she saw no obvious signs of distress. Police say a suspect shot at them with a rifle; Chambers says she didn't know Smith had a gun. Smith was undergoing surgery at the same area hospital where the officers were being treated for injuries that were not life-threatening. 10:30 a.m. A Baton Rouge neighborhood was awakened early by a hail of gunfire that police say was sparked by a confrontation between an armed suspect and two police officers. Several neighbors living near the house where the confrontation occurred told The Associated Press they heard dozens of shots fired. Terrell Starwood, who was staying at a friend's house that was close to the scene when he heard sirens, followed by a barrage of gunfire. The 31-year-old Starwood says "you could tell they were from different guns." He says all he heard was "sirens, gunshots and tires squealing." Dozens of evidence markers were placed in the street, indicating the possible presence of shell casings and other evidence. 9:30 a.m. District Attorney Hillar Moore says investigators will study video footage taken by the dashboard cameras in two police cruisers for evidence into a shooting in Baton Rouge early Saturday that left two officers and a suspect injured. The officers were responding to a report that someone was damaging property when a suspect jumped into a vehicle and drove off. He led police on a 2-mile chase before bailing out of the car with a rifle. He fired at the two officers, striking both of them. A bullet grazed the head of one officer; the other officer was hit in the stomach but protected by his bulletproof vest. "Both of these officers were very fortunate to survive this encounter," Moore said. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said he does not believe the officers' injuries are life-threatening. The suspect was also shot and was undergoing surgery at an area hospital. 8:20 a.m. Two Baton Rouge police officers who were shot during a confrontation with a suspect are in stable condition at an area hospital. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said he does not believe the officers' injuries are life-threatening. Dabadie said the suspect was also shot and is undergoing surgery. Police say the suspect led the officers on a 2-mile vehicle chase early Saturday, then exited his vehicle with a rifle and fired at them. The officers returned fire, striking the suspect. Police in Louisiana say two officers and one suspect are being treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds after a confrontation in Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola says the officers confronted the suspect after a 2-mile vehicle chase early Saturday. The suspect exited his vehicle with a rifle after the chase and fired at the officers, hitting both. The officers returned fire and struck the suspect. All three are hospitalized. Their conditions were not immediately available.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":70,"startIndex":59,"value":"BATON ROUGE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":241,"startIndex":241,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-13","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"LA - Louisiana","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Officers from the city’s Health Department, Code Enforcement Office and police department, as well as the state Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement, conducted a joint inspection at the bar, at 88 Poplar St., on Wednesday, according to a news release city officials issued Wednesday night. They found numerous alleged violations that resulted in the closure of the establishment and an apartment on the second floor of the building, according to the news release. The bar will remain closed until the violations are corrected, officials said. Two people were shot and wounded at Locals 88 at about 12:55 a.m. Sunday. Police have not released the names of the shooting victims, who were taken to a local hospital with what police described as non-life-threatening injuries. Several violent crimes, including a homicide, have been reported at or near the bar in the past few years. In March 2013, Renold P. Julien, 26, was shot and killed in the parking lot of Locals 88. In November 2012, at least one person was shot after a dispute at the bar. In February 2012, a man with a shotgun robbed a taxi driver who was waiting for a customer outside the bar. In August 2009, authorities raided the establishment, then named the Poplar Inn, as part of a string of drug busts at several sites in the area.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":81,"startIndex":69,"value":"WILKES-BARRE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":840,"startIndex":831,"value":"12:55 a.m"},"date":"2016-02-04","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":521,"startIndex":516,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Jimmy Methe, 49, was charged with voluntary manslaughter in the death of Bran­don Scott Spencer, Kershaw County Sheriff Jim Matthews said in a statement. Spencer was shot once in the head. Depu­ties found his body in the road about 35 yards from Methe’s truck, Matthews said. “The law states that you can use deadly force to protect yourself, your family or someone who is in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm,” Matthews said. “The law does not allow you to shoot and kill someone who has stolen from you and is fleeing.” Methe had previously been robbed of two firearms by thieves who broke into a vehicle, and his neighborhood had seen several vehicles and homes robbed in the past six months, Matthews said. Investigators said they recovered items taken from Methe’s truck, along with a gas can and hose that might have been used to siphon gas from the vehicle, Matthews said. Methe was cooperative with officers who responded to reports of a shooting about 3 a.m. Saturday, turned over his gun and was taken into custody without incident, Mat­thews said. He was being held at the county jail until a bond hearing. “Law-abiding citizens are frustrated with the failure of our criminal justice system that really does not deter crime,” Matthews said. “Situations like what occurred early this morning are more and more likely to be the result of that frustration.”	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":71,"startIndex":65,"value":"CAMDEN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-12","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"SC - South Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":240,"oldEnd":239,"oldStart":233,"startIndex":234,"value":"early "}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":282,"startIndex":280,"value":"49"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":278,"startIndex":267,"value":"Jimmy Methe"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":162,"startIndex":160,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":362,"startIndex":340,"value":"Bran\u00addon Scott Spencer"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3LZCR1FDVSVQ8

Moments after Andrew Duncan tried to walk away from the mobile home he shared with his roommate Cody Nelson, he lay dead in the snow of multiple gunshot wounds. After the shouting subsided, a single shot and a scream followed by the emptying of a gun clip echoed throughout the Ponderosa Mobile Home Park, according to a witness who asked to only to be identified by his first name, Thomas. Duncan, 31, was transported to Boulder Community Health where he was later pronounced dead. Shortly afterward, suspected shooter Cody Nelson, 51, was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and prohibited use of a weapon. Also arrested was Miriam L. Nayeh, 31, for investigation of being an accessory to murder in the first degree and domestic violence. With a semblance of normalcy returning to the north Boulder mobile home park on Saturday, an eyewitness account has provided new insight into what exactly occurred. "A man I didn't recognize seemed to be walking away from some sort of confrontation with a woman grabbing at his shirt and trying to hold him back," said Thomas. "Next thing I know [Cody] Nelson walks out and shoots him point blank; he emptied the clip into him once he was laid down." The woman attempting to keep Duncan from leaving before he was shot dead is believed to be Nayeh, who lived in the neighboring trailer, according to residents. Moments before the shooting, the man later identified as Duncan tossed a package into the snow as Nayeh continued to grab and hold onto his clothing, according to Thomas. "While [Duncan] walked away he tried to toss a package he had in his hand off into the snow," he said. "Right after the gunshots stopped I saw the two of them grab the package out of the snow and another from his jacket." The witness speculated that the argument revolved around drugs and believed that it is what the packages ultimately contained. But authorities have not confirmed that. "I didn't see or know if that's why they were fighting or if that's what was in those packages," said Thomas. "I just can't imagine he shot a man for any other reason." With Nelson now in custody and transported to the county jail, his likely first court appearance will take place 2 p.m. Monday. "His first appearance in court will just simply involve the suspect being advised of his certain rights and the current charges against him," said Assistant District Attorney Ryan Brackley. "While this is just an initial appearance, there is a possibility that they may have a discussion over whether or not the judge will set bond."

(AP) — A police officer in suburban Atlanta was shot twice and killed Thursday by a suspect who was also wounded during a law enforcement operation, authorities said. Maj. Greg Barney, a 25-year veteran of the Riverdale police department, died following surgery, said Riverdale police chief Todd Spivey. "We have lost a valuable member of our family," Spivey said. Riverdale City Manager E. Scott Wood said Barney was struck in the mid-torso and arm. The shooting happened as Riverdale police officers were assisting Clayton County police with an operation at an apartment complex in Riverdale late Thursday morning, Assistant Chief Michael Reynolds said. Reynolds did not release any details about the police operation or say what led to the shooting. He also did not release the suspect's name or condition. Riverdale is a city of about 15,000 people just south of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting, said GBI spokesman Scott Dutton. The body of the officer has been taken to the GBI headquarters, where an autopsy will be performed Friday morning, he said. In 2004, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Barney became the first African-American to serve as Riverdale's police chief when he accepted the interim position after the retirement of Mike Edwards. Barney's stint as chief lasted five months.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":98,"startIndex":89,"value":"RIVERDALE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-11","details":{"endIndex":697,"startIndex":661,"value":"at an apartment complex in Riverdale"},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":719,"startIndex":712,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":287,"startIndex":271,"value":"Maj.

3845	http://finance.yahoo.com/news/authorities-phoenix-area-high-school-amid-shooting-report-154817410.html	Two 15-year-old girls fatally shot at Phoenix-area school - Yahoo Finance	Two 15-year-old girls fatally shot at Phoenix-area school - Yahoo FinanceGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Two 15-year-old girls died Friday in a shooting at a suburban Phoenix high school that initially caused panic among parents who could not reach their children but later emerged as a murder-suicide. Police announced that a suicide note was found at the shooting scene near the cafeteria area of Independence High School in Glendale. They said the girls each were shot once, were declared dead at the scene and a weapon was found near the bodies. "Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appeared to also be in a relationship," Glendale police spokeswoman Tracey Breeden said in a statement Friday afternoon. Breeden said it is believed nobody witnessed the shooting. Both teens have been identified, but Breeden said "their names will not be confirmed or released at this time by the police department due to their juvenile status." Hours before the lockdown of the school was lifted, hundreds of worried parents crowded the parking lots of nearby discount and convenience stores. One woman gnawed on her fingernails as she spoke on a cellphone, while another had tears streaming down her face. Other parents chain-smoked as they waited for news. Cheryl Rice said she went to a store after a friend called about the shooting and asked about Rice's 15-year-old daughter. But the girl called to say she was safe as Rice arrived at the store. She said it was horrible waiting for word about her child. "You don't know if it's your daughter or not. You don't know who's being bullied. You don't know who is being picked on. You don't know anything. It could be anybody," Rice said. Lanie Walter, who is a senior at the school, heard ambulances on her way to campus but didn't think much of it until her first class was locked down. When she called her parents to tell them she was safe, "my mom was actually really relieved because she was watching it on the news," she said. Parents were bused to the school to be reunited with their children. Some cut through a nearby field as they rushed toward their kids in emotional reunions. Other students who got permission from their parents left campus on their own. The Glendale Union High School District alerted parents to the shooting through emails and automatic phone calls and released information on social media, Superintendent Brian Capistran said. Students typically are not allowed to use their cellphones during lockdowns, but as calls from parents flooded the district, officials asked teachers to have students call family, Capistran said. Social workers and counselors will be available to students and staff when school resumes Tuesday, the superintendent said. Minnie Kramer, mother of a 15-year-old student, said she rushed out of work when she got a text from her son right after the shooting, telling her that he was OK. As she waited to be reunited with her son, Kramer said she worried about whether any of his friends were harmed. "I know that my son is OK, but, emotionally, you don't know what it does, especially at 15, especially if it's someone he knew," Kramer said. Associated Press photographer Matt York and writer Samantha Shotzbarger contributed to this report.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":81,"startIndex":73,"value":"GLENDALE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-12","details":{"endIndex":2284,"startIndex":2249,"value":"Glendale Union High School District"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":103,"startIndex":101,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":103,"startIndex":101,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":103,"startIndex":101,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":103,"startIndex":101,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2YUPBJCWKEFPW

That 31-year old man had reportedly stumbled into the One Stop Smoke Shop at 4645 South, 4000 West. Steven Sudweeks works as a clerk at the shop, and he said he saw the man come in through the doors. "He leaned on the counter... and just said he'd been shot," Sudweeks recounted. "He wasn't screaming or anything. That's why I thought he was joking at first." But he soon realized the man, who is reportedly a regular customer, had indeed been shot in the back near his shoulder. Sudweeks said they called for help, and another clerk stayed by the man's side. "He was trying to kind of make sure everything was good, he kept the pressure on the wound, just made sure he was OK," he explained. The clerk, he continued, "Made sure he didn't pass out or lose consciousness and waited until the cops got there." Lt. Taylor said when police showed up, the man was in too much pain to talk. He said the man suffered internal bleeding from the single bullet wound, which appeared to come from a rifle or handgun. It was clear the man had been shot; but by who, where and with what kind of gun, remained a mystery. "We have a lot of questions that we need to ask our victim," Taylor said. "While he was on scene, he wasn't giving a whole lot of answers." While the area is busy, with several shops and stores nearby, Lt. Taylor said no one heard gunshots or witnessed the shooting. Sudweeks said the man was able to tell the other clerk before police arrived that he'd been shot near the Home Depot, behind the smoke shop. While the man is a regular customer, he said they don't know a lot about him. "We don't know his name, but he-- nice guy. He comes in, buys cigars all the time," he said. He said the customer was always positive and smiling when they saw him. That's part of what makes the entire ordeal so hard to process, he said. "It's scary," he said. "It's just unnerving." Lt. Taylor said Saturday night that the victim was sent to surgery. His name has not been released. I’ve made $76,000 so far this year working online and I’m a full time student. Im using an online business opportunity I heard about and I’ve made such great money. It’s really user friendly and I’m just so happy that I found out about it.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1344,"startIndex":1325,"value":"single bullet wound"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":1392,"startIndex":1376,"value":"rifle or handgun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":209,"startIndex":193,"value":"West Valley City"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":351,"startIndex":342,"value":"5:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-06","details":{"endIndex":488,"oldEnd":487,"oldStart":441,"startIndex":442,"value":"One Stop Smoke Shop at 4645 South, 4000 West.

3931	http://gazette.com/man-charged-with-murder-in-georgia-lawmans-shooting-death/article/feed/316316	Man charged with murder in Georgia lawman's shooting death | Colorado Springs Gazette, News	Man charged with murder in Georgia lawman's shooting death | Colorado Springs Gazette, NewsATLANTA (AP) — A suspect accused of gunning down a Georgia lawman has been charged with murder in the death of the 25-year police veteran. The fallen officer was struck by two shots as he helped colleagues serve a "no knock" search warrant at an apartment complex near Atlanta, authorities said Friday. Maj. Greg Barney, a well-known figure in the community of Riverdale, died following surgery after Thursday's shooting, said Riverdale Police Chief Todd Spivey. Friends and colleagues were in mourning and two candles glowed outside police headquarters in the small suburban city of about 15,000. Barney was shot while helping Clayton County officers serve a search warrant at an apartment complex in Riverdale, south of Atlanta's airport. Riverdale officers, including Barney, were guarding the perimeter while Clayton County police entered the apartment, police said. When officers entered the apartment, Jerand Ross, 24, bolted through a back door, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement Friday. Barney chased Ross, who shot him once in the abdomen and once in an arm, according to the statement. The statement added that a Clayton County officer, Lt. Francisco Romero, pursued Ross as he ran behind the apartment buildings. After a short chase, Ross pointed a handgun at Romero, who shot the 24-year-old in the head, the GBI statement added. Ross remains hospitalized at Atlanta Medical Center and is expected to survive, GBI spokesman Scott Dutton said Friday. It was unclear if Ross had an attorney. The GBI's investigation includes observations from a witness, who saw Ross with two handguns while fleeing from the officers, according to the GBI statement. "The witness saw Ross throw one of the handguns into the woods behind an apartment building," the GBI said in a statement. That gun was later found by a police dog. Barney's body was taken to the GBI headquarters, where an autopsy was planned. After the shooting, a flower wreath was left outside Riverdale police headquarters. WSB-TV showed images of two candles glowing outside the police department's entrance. At a nearby church, Frances Lee said a message was being put on the sign: "Our prayers are with the Barney family." Barney was well-known in Riverdale, a city suburb just south of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Residents recalled him as a police department commander and school resource officer who left a strong impression. In 2004, Barney became the first African-American to serve as Riverdale's police chief when he accepted the interim post after the retirement of its chief. He served as interim chief for five months, the Atlanta newspaper reported. "Because of his charismatic personality, Major Barney was an iconic figure in the City of Riverdale," Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill said in a statement. "Anyone who ever lived or worked in the Riverdale knew him, and his name was synonymous with the city." Akeem Bivins said he first me Barney at Riverdale High School, when he was a student and Barney was the school resource officer. Barney often spoke to him about staying on the right path, he told WXIA-TV. "He had a positive vibe," Bivens said. "He made me want to do right; he made me want to make my mom proud of me." Associated Press writer Jonathan Landrum Jr. contributed to this story.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1179,"startIndex":1128,"value":"who shot him once in the abdomen and once in an arm"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":98,"startIndex":91,"value":"ATLANTA"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-04","details":{"endIndex":830,"startIndex":771,"value":" apartment complex in Riverdale, south of Atlanta's airport"},"state":"GA - Georgia","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1014,"startIndex":1012,"value":"24"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1010,"startIndex":999,"value":"Jerand Ross"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":410,"startIndex":393,"value":" Maj.

3939	http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/05/06/teen-accused-of-shooting-father-in-head-living-with-body-for-a-week/	Teen Accused Of Shooting Father In Head, Living With Body For A Week « CBS Denver	Teen Accused Of Shooting Father In Head, Living With Body For A Week « CBS DenverGYPSUM, Colo. (CBS4) – Investigators say a 13-year-old boy shot and killed his father and tried to conceal the slaying from authorities. The Eagle County Sheriff’s Office says the young suspect lived alone in the house in Gypsum with the victim’s lifeless body for nearly a week. Gypsum is a small town in western Eagle County. Neighbors told CBS4 Joseph Kelly Jr. and his son Kai Kelly lived in the home for more than a year but no one heard anything out of the ordinary about a week ago. It wasn’t until a deputy showed up that the boy admitted his father was dead inside. It was some time around April 29 or 30 when Kai Kelly allegedly got his hands on rifle. “There’s a little office area off the kitchen,” Eagle County coroner Kara Bettis said. Kai allegedly fired at least two shots. “There was one to the back of the head and one to the temple,” Bettis said. “The one to the temple was contact and the one in the back of his head was from farther away.” Kai Kelly ended up calling into his father’s work every day reporting his father as sick. After a few days the supervisor from this county-run transit department got suspicious and called police. “He had been dead for around six days,” Bettis said. Eagle County Sheriff Joseph Hoy says they’ve only been called to the house once — a year ago — for a domestic dispute between the parents. “The juvenile answered the door and told deputies that his 50-year-old father was deceased in the residence,” Hoy said. While the boy admitted his father was dead, the sheriff says there’s still no motive. On Tuesday the sheriff’s office told CBS4 the teen’s mother has not been living in the home with her son or ex-husband but won’t release any more information. Kai Kelly is in the juvenile facility in Jefferson County but has been charged with first-degree murder.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":869,"startIndex":851,"value":"at least two shots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":742,"startIndex":737,"value":"rifle"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":87,"startIndex":81,"value":"GYPSUM"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-04-29","details":{"endIndex":407,"startIndex":373,"value":"small town in western Eagle County"},"state":"CO - Colorado","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":135,"startIndex":124,"value":"13-year-old"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":468,"oldEnd":467,"oldStart":457,"startIndex":458,"value":"Kai Kelly "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":444,"startIndex":429,"value":"Joseph Kelly Jr"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2ZGQEM7UFJHHS

This account contradicts an earlier version of the incident given by Johnson, who told The New York Times this weekend that two officers “struggled” with Taylor before the shooting. Johnson said on Tuesday he had “serious concerns” about Officer Brad Miller’s need to use lethal force, but a grand jury will ultimately decide whether he should be charged criminally. From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: While outlining the events leading up to the fatal shooting of Christian Taylor, Johnson said rookie officer Brad Miller “exercised poor judgment” that led to “cascading consequences.” Miller’s “unilateral decision to enter the building alone and to pursue [Christian Taylor] helped create an unrecoverable outcome,” Johnson said, adding that the decision put other officers on the scene at risk. On social media, Star-Telegram reporter Monica S. Nagy tweeted further details of the shooting as offered by Johnson on Tuesday. As he was still in field training, Officer Miller is reportedly unable to appeal his termination.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":120,"startIndex":111,"value":"Arlington"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":616,"startIndex":605,"value":"Brad Miller"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":197,"startIndex":181,"value":"Christian Taylor"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME
3969	http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/02/10/gunman-fires-shots-in-walmart-shoppers-duck-for-cover/	Gunman Fires Shots In Walmart, Shoppers Duck For Cover « CBS Dallas / Fort Worth	Gunman Fires Shots In Walmart, Shoppers Duck For Cover « CBS Dallas / Fort WorthDALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – It was a scary scene overnight for shoppers at the Walmart Super Center in the 7400 block of Samuel Boulevard. Customers were ducking and running for cover after a would-be robber started shooting inside the store. The shooting happened just before 10 p.m. Tuesday and the store is open and back to business. But security could regularly be seen monitoring the parking lot. The scene wasn’t as calm last night at the 24-hour store, when shoppers and workers said they heard gunshots. Witness Shantel Mims said there was no mistaking the startling sound of gunfire. “You don’t hear gunshots at Walmart. It wasn’t no BB gun. It wasn’t no balloon.” According to police, the would-be robber went into the Super Center and tried to hold up the cashier at register #24. When the cashier follow his commands fast enough, the suspect reportedly fired three shots into the ground and then, while heading out the front door, fired his gun a few more times. This morning officials revealed that an officer with the Dallas Police Department was nearby, heard the shots and went to the store. The officer arrived as the suspect was running out the front door and actually saw the man, now identified as 36-year-old Marcus Booker, fire a weapon into the air. Booker, in his attempt to get away, had reported walked between several cars in the Walmart parking lot when the officer confronted him and shouted for him to get on the ground. Police say Booker hesitated and then dropped what they believed was a handgun. Booker also began taking off his shirt. As the officer approached, a Walmart shopper and an off-duty sheriff’s officer came up behind Booker and helped take him into custody. The sheriff’s officer was actually working at the store in an off-duty capacity. There were several people in the store when the incident happened, and many of them reportedly started running as soon as they heard shots fired. “I was in there shopping with my mama and we saw the police run in, heard some gunshots. After I heard the gunshots and saw everybody duck, I ducked and ran,” shopper Roderick Ridge explained. “After that, we came outside and the police made everybody else come out.” DPD officials say no one, including the suspect, was hurt during the incident. Marcus Booker is being charged with Aggravated Robbery. He is currently being held in the Lew Sterret Jail on a $100,000 bond. (©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

Roger Hawkins is at Eskenazi Hospital undergoing a mental evaluation. He was initially sent to APC, but the decision was made to transfer him to Eskenazi. INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (February 13, 2016) –An eight-year veteran of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) is in good condition after being shot in the arm early Saturday morning. The incident began around 3:30 a.m. when officers responded to a call regarding a prowler in the 1100 block of McDougal Street on the south side of Indianapolis. Upon arrival, officers located the caller who told them gunshots had been fired throughout the night from a nearby home, damaging her residence. When officers began walking toward the residence, a man started firing shots at them, and one officer was hit in the left forearm, police said. The injured officer, later identified as Southeast District Patrol Officer Mark Reynolds, is recovering at Methodist Hospital, according to Captain Richard Riddle with IMPD. Officer Reynolds underwent successful surgery to repair a broken arm , and he is in good condition. Mayor Joe Hogsett was at the hospital with the officer and the officer’s family this morning. A perimeter was established around the home, and the accused shooter – later identified as Roger Hawkins, 50, - barricaded himself inside the home. Hawkins continued to sporadically fire shots from inside the residence. The IMPD SWAT team was called to the scene, and over the next three hours, negotiators attempted to convince him to surrender peacefully. However, Hawkins continued to fire his gun from inside the home. When further negotiations with him to surrender peacefully were unsuccessful, chemical agents were thrown into the house. Hawkins eventually exited the residence and the SWAT team used less-lethal beanbag rounds to subdue him and take him into custody. Hawkins has been preliminarily charged with two counts of attempted murder and criminal recklessness. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to our officer and his family for a speedy recovery,” IMPD Chief Troy Riggs said. “This incident could have resulted in a number of casualties, but I am proud of our officers for bringing this incident to a peaceful resolution. I would like to thank the community for their outpouring of concern and support for our wounded officer. I’d also like to thank all the public safety and medical professionals who assisted us today.” The name of the injured officer has not been released at this time.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":360,"startIndex":348,"value":"INDIANAPOLIS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":572,"startIndex":566,"value":" 3:30 "},"date":"2016-02-14","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":575,"startIndex":572,"value":"a.m"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1468,"startIndex":1465,"value":" 50"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":1464,"startIndex":1451,"value":"Roger Hawkins"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":106,"startIndex":90,"value":"Officer Reynolds"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AGBYMQY1J7PKK

The officer who shot the black male of about 18 years of age is a veteran of more than 10 years on the Austin force. The race of the officer was not given but the killing comes as protesters in San Antonio are questioning if race was at play in the fatal shooting by police in the city to the southwest of Austin last week of an unarmed black man. Austin police said they received multiple phone calls of the man acting suspiciously and aggressively. Officers arrived on the scene and confronted the man, a police official said. "This subject did not comply with the commands that the officer was giving and instead charged at the officer," Brian Manley, chief of staff for the Austin Police Department, told reporters. "The subject was struck by the gunfire," he said adding he died later at an area hospital. Part of the incident was recorded on police video camera. The shooting was not on camera but there is audio available, he said. Manley did not say if the man had a weapon. He added officers did not deploy Tasers on the suspect. Several incidents nationwide in the past several months where unarmed minorities have been fatally shot by police have raised questions about the role of race in U.S. policing and spawned numerous protests.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":74,"startIndex":68,"value":"AUSTIN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":252,"startIndex":225,"value":"in a neighborhood of Austin"},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Yes","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":298,"startIndex":292,"value":"black "},"victim-was":["killed","injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AI4J8TH0Y11X5

The school district tells us that two of the victims are Muskegon Heights students. All four victims have been treated and released from the hospital. Muskegon Heights Public School Academy System Superintendent Alena Zachery-Ross released this statement Wednesday: We are sickened by the acts of violence that occurred outside of our school building last night. We are saddened that two of our own high school students were injured. However, we do not know what their current condition is. We will do everything we can to assist these students and their families. While classes are cancelled today, we will open the high school at 10:00 a.m. to our students and staff. Crisis response teams will be available until 1:00 p.m. today, and throughout the rest of the week as needed. It is important to know that media will not be allowed in our parking lots until 3 p.m. when I will make a public statement outside the main entrance of the high school. Our students are our top priority right now and our number one focus. Because of this, I will not be speaking to media until 3 p.m. Finally, our hearts and thoughts are with all those involved. We will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as the investigation continues. You can read the complete letter sent home to parents here : Parent Letter Grand Rapids Public Schools sent out the following statement Wednesday afternoon: “Following the basketball games last night in Muskegon Heights, several people were involved in a shooting near Muskegon Heights High School. Student safety is and always will be a top priority. Before the game, we were made aware that there was a potential issue involving a few individuals. We took extra precautions to ensure our student athletes’ safety, including bringing additional public safety officers and administrators. All three basketball games were played without incident. Following the game, the student athletes were escorted to their busses by staff and safely transported home We also coordinated with Muskegon Heights Public Schools, who worked with Muskegon Heights Police Department, Muskegon County Sheriff’s Office, and Michigan State Police, to ensure that we had additional security measures in place, as well as an increased police presence. The individuals were identified and were not allowed access to the premises. As a result, they took their dispute to a nearby location and made the incredibly poor decision to allow it to escalate into violence. Our thoughts are with those who were injured, including two Muskegon Heights students. Thanks to quick police action, the alleged shooter is in custody and multiple charges have been filed by the prosecutor’s office. The alleged shooter is not a GRPS student. We will remain in contact with law enforcement as they continue their investigation.” Muskegon Heights interim Police Chief Dr. Joseph Thomas told FOX17 they believe the situation started following a fight in Grand Rapids sometime last week. He said authorities received information that individuals involved with the incident last week might try to 'settle the score' at a basketball game hosted by Muskegon Heights High School vs. Ottawa Hills on Tuesday evening. Precautionary measures were taken prior to tonight's basketball game according to Chief Thomas, including having officers from the Michigan State Police and the Muskegon County Sheriff's Department in the area. "Between the Muskegon Heights Police Department, The Sheriff's Department and the Michigan State Police, we did everything we could to stop this from happening," said Chief Thomas. One of the two shooting incidents, which happened in close proximity to one another, includes a deputy-involved shooting, which is now under investigation by the Michigan State Police. "We know for a fact that a least one person was armed with a weapon, with a firearm, confronted the deputy, refused to comply with the orders to surrender the firearm, and the deputy responded accordingly," said Muskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler. "This could have been a very tragic situation. We could have had a lot more injuries, we could have had a lot more issues to deal with if we had not responded in the matter we did," Roesler said. "The Sheriff's Office will be conducting an internal investigation to review the deputies' actions, but from all the information that I've been given and what others have told me, at this point, it appears the deputy acted within policy and state law." The deputy involved in the shooting wasn't injured. Initially, authorities reported 3 people had been hurt in the incidents, later finding a fourth person who'd been injured while canvassing the surrounding area. The injured people include two males and two females. Chief Thomas says some of the suspects involved in Tuesday night's incidents are now in custody. Names of people involved in these incidents haven't been released. Grand Rapids Public Schools spokesperson John Helmholdt told FOX17 Tuesday evening student athletes from his district weren't involved in the incidents, and transported home by bus from the area safely. Schools were closed on Wednesday and counselors are being made available from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for any students or faculty who may want to discuss what happened.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":102,"startIndex":86,"value":"MUSKEGON HEIGHTS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-10","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

The unidentified man was in his Houston home on Tuesday when three burglars suddenly kicked in the door, beat him up, and put him in an upstairs closet. Little did they know, that closet just so happened to be where the man kept his guns. Waiting until the coast was clear, the victim armed himself and exited the closet. He proceeded downstairs, where he encountered one of the three perps, and gunfire was exchanged. The burglar was struck in the shoulder and leg; the victim was unharmed. The two other intruders quickly fled the scene in a Chevy Tahoe. Their injured accomplice chased after them for a short while before collapsing on the street. A neighbor told the Houston Chronicle that at least two other break-ins have occurred in the last three weeks. "With what's happening, my neighbors and I are aware they're all connected," he said. ""What happened today is exactly what guns are supposed to do - to protect your home and defend your life and your family."

Just after 10 p.m. Thursday, the Lake County Sheriff's Office got a 911 call from a female saying she'd just been stabbed multiple times and needed to be rescued. When deputies arrived to the 2925 River Road home, they found the suspect, Thomas Hirko, 54, with what appeared to be a gun outside of the home. Investigators say one of the deputies repeatedly ordered Hirko to drop the weapon, which he did not do. When Hirko raised the gun again toward a deputy, the deputy fired four times. Hirko was hit twice. He was taken to the emergency room where he was pronounced dead. The stabbing victim, Hirko's wife, Lorrie Osborne-Hirko, 55, was taken to the hospital with stab wounds to her back and chest. She is expected to survive despite "severe" injuries. Lake County Sheriff Daniel Dunlap said at a press conference that while Hirko appeared to have a real gun, it was determined he had an airsoft pistol. At one point, Hirko "stated something to the nature that it's time to die. We don't know if that meant it was time for Mrs. Hirko to die or time for him to die or time for both to die. But a statement...was made," Dunlap said. Dunlap said Hirko has somewhat of a violent history. In 2003, police were called because Hirko had barricaded himself in a home and said he would commit suicide if any officers tried to reach him. According to a Willowick police report, Hirko was “highly intoxicated” during the barricade incident and stated he “advised he will kill himself if officers attempt entry.” Regarding Thursday night's shooting, Dunlap said "the deputy was forced to make that tough decision and fired upon him, striking him twice." He said it "doesn't appear" that any policy was violated, but detectives are still investigating what happened. A total of three deputies were involved in the incident, and their names are not yet being released. Only one fired shots. The deputies involved in the shooting have been removed from shift duties in keeping with the sheriff's office policy protocols regarding deadly force incidents.

According to the Dallas Observer, the rampage started around 10:30 last night. Bowser walked into his ex-girlfriend's apartment in Dallas and opened fire on four people, killing two and injuring a couple more. He then drove to his ex-wife's house in nearby DeSoto, Texas. Here, he threw a grenade in the house, and when it detonated, entered after it. Bowser shot until he was out of ammo. When he stopped, he'd murdered two and wounded two more. Police arrived quickly on the scene. WFAA reports that when cops entered the home, Bowser pretended to be one of the victims until authorities realized he didn't have a scratch on him and detained him. That's when the dancer revealed he once served in the Army. In addition to volunteering with the Mavs Maniaacs, Bowser was also a special education teacher from 2001 to 2010, before resigning.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":706,"startIndex":682,"value":"until he was out of ammo"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":456,"oldEnd":455,"oldStart":448,"startIndex":449,"value":"Dallas "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":384,"startIndex":379,"value":"10:30"},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"TX - Texas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":130,"startIndex":109,"value":"Erbie \"E-Luv\" Bowser,"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME

Aaren O’Connor, 25, was in the Heart of Chicago area talking on the phone with her father in San Diego when she was shot around 7:30 p.m., according to police. When she was shot, the call cut out, but father, David O’Connor, eventually got her on the line, the Tribune reports. “She was having trouble speaking,” he told the Tribune. “She didn’t know where she was. She kept saying her head hurts, her head hurts. I thought maybe she was having a stroke or something.” Soon after, O’Connor’s roommate found O’Connor, fatally injured but still alive, in O’Connor’s car. O’Connor was taken to Stroger Hospital, where on Sunday evening, doctors declared her brain dead, according to the Tribune. O’Connor was kept on life support long enough to donate her organs. Police have no one in custody for the shooting. Since O'Connor's death, her coworkers have set up a GoFundMe where visitors can donate in O'Connor's name to help at-risk Chicago students study abroad, as O'Connor did. The fund also aims, longer-term, to help at-risk youth "receive the caring and resources they need to choose a non-violent path and open their hearts to others. O’Connor’s father is helping to raise money for the fund, which as of today has raised just shy of $30,000. “People need to know what’s going on and what kind of loss is taking place here,” her father told the Tribune. “I want her name and her voice to be the impetus for bringing all this violence to an end."	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":271,"startIndex":263,"value":"Chicago "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":360,"startIndex":351,"value":"7:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":271,"startIndex":254,"value":"Heart of Chicago "},"state":"IL - Illinois","time-day":{"endIndex":195,"startIndex":188,"value":"evening"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":241,"startIndex":239,"value":"25"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":237,"startIndex":223,"value":"Aaren O\u2019Connor"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","hospitalized"]}]}	A2ZRF4I5RTKN7G

Columbia police are looking for two suspects who crashed a stolen car and shot at a man Monday morning. Letitia Baskett reported her Toyota Camry stolen Monday morning. She told police she left the keys in the ignition before going to work. “I wanted to warm up the car,” she said. “I went back inside of my house for a few seconds, came back out, and my car was gone.” Baskett’s son told police he spotted the stolen car around 11 a.m. near Farrow Road and followed it a short distance. He caught up with the suspects, talked with them and demanded that they get out of his mother’s vehicle, according to Police Chief Skip Holbrook. The suspects drove away, then ran off the road and crashed into the Greenview neighborhood sign at the intersection of Farrow Road and Easter Street in the city limits, according Holbrook. Baskett’s son told police at least one of the suspects shot at him at Farrow Road and Easter Street while he tried to chase them. He was not wounded. “A car is a car. It can be replaced,” Baskett said. “I’m glad nothing happened to my son.” Holbrook asked anyone with information about the incident to contact Crimestoppers. Holbrook and Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott have advised residents not to leave cars unattended while warming up.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":160,"startIndex":152,"value":"Columbia"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":615,"startIndex":608,"value":"11 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-15","details":{"endIndex":1101,"startIndex":1071,"value":" Farrow Road and Easter Street"},"state":"SC - South Carolina","time-day":{"endIndex":281,"startIndex":274,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]}]}	A1ENHFQSXOXG6I

Following the shooting, the victim, who has been identified as Trevon Harris, was taken to the hospital with serious injuries after shots were fired into his vehicle. Precious Nicholson says she saw an SUV pull up alongside another vehicle at Teutonia and Capitol on April 23rd, and someone inside started shooting. “Two cars pull up — one of the cars, an SUV, just get to ringing shots out. Raise down his window and get to shooting at the other car. I guess he hit the other car because the car couldn’t pull off in time. He pressed on the gas. He couldn’t pull off his green light. He still there. Other SUV went down Capitol up to Sherman. The other car went too. Police told us the man got hit. There was a police car right behind the SUV and the car that was shooting. The police officer pulled down here by this yellow thing right here. I says ‘you gotta turn around! They shooting! They shooting!’ He says ‘where?’ I says ‘right in front of you!’ And then he looked and by the time he looked, the car was gone. Then he pulled around and pulled over. They wasn’t yelling. Was no words. They pulled up to the lights and just got to shooting. No words. It was nothing. He just got to shooting,” Precious Nicholson said. Nicholson said she’s fed up with all the violence we’ve seen in Milwaukee. “We got babies out here! It’s kids out here! I mean, come on now! Milwaukee is getting crazy. It’s crazy. We can’t even walk down the street without something happening. I can’t work. I can’t do nothing. Why? Cuz I’m scared for my life. It’s sad. You can’t even walk down the streets no more. There’s babies out here dying for no reason. No reason at all. I’m scared. Milwaukee needs to do something about this,” Nicholson said. No further details have been released in this case.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":102,"startIndex":93,"value":"MILWAUKEE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-04","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

(AP) — The Latest on an officer shot in northwest Mississippi (all times local): 4:10 p.m. Authorities in northwest Mississippi say police are questioning a man believed to have shot a Clarksdale police officer point-blank in the face and a man believed to be his accomplice in an earlier robbery. Clarksdale Mayor Bill Luckett says it will be up to police to identify the men, who were being questioned Sunday afternoon. Luckett says video shows that one ran as Cpl. Derrick Couch's patrol car drove up. He says Couch got out of the car, apparently to question the other, who pulled a pistol and shot him late Saturday. Couch is in critical condition at the area's top trauma center, Regional One Health in Memphis, Tennessee. The mayor says the shooting occurred about four blocks from a convenience store that had just been robbed. He says all three men are African-American. 2:45 p.m. Authorities in northwest Mississippi say police are questioning a man believed to have shot a Clarksdale police officer point-blank in the face. Clarksdale Mayor Bill Luckett says police found "telling evidence" at the family's home early Sunday, and the man's father brought him to the police station Sunday afternoon. Luckett says video shows that Cpl. Derrick Couch got out of his patrol car, apparently to question the man, who pulled a pistol and shot him late Saturday. He says Couch is on a ventilator, has lost one eye, and the bullet remains lodged in his brain. He says the shooting occurred about four blocks from a convenience store that had just been robbed. Luckett says the store and City Hall are at opposite ends of the same block, facing different directions. 11:59 a.m. Authorities in northwest Mississippi say an officer is in critical condition after being shot in the head while investigating a robbery across the street from a police station. Nursing supervisor Vivian Crawford said Sunday that Derrick Couch is in critical condition at Regional One Health in Memphis. Mayor Bill Luckett tells WMC-TV (http://bit.ly/20TnatX ) that Cpl. Couch was found on the street outside a convenience store that had been robbed late Saturday by two masked men. The report said the store is across from a police station. WREG-TV (http://bit.ly/1TgYJR4 ) reports that police have released a video of two possible suspects, including one with a noticeable limp. This story has been corrected to show that Derrick Couch is a corporal, not an officer.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":103,"startIndex":93,"value":"CLARKSDALE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":201,"startIndex":192,"value":"4:10 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-14","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MO - Missouri","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

The officer-involved shooting happened at an apartment complex at 1610 County Road B in Roseville, around 10 p.m. Wednesday. They’d been called there after other building residents said they heard profanities being yelled, and items being thrown at the wall in an apartment. According to a news release sent out by Roseville Police Thursday afternoon: Officers on the scene decided to forcibly enter the apartment after hearing an “agitated and distressed” sounding male inside, who initially told authorities he was fine but refused to open the door, began talking to himself, then stopped responding. Police also discovered an active misdemeanor warrant the suspect had. Officers announced they were entering then began searching, when K-9 officer Otis alerted officers to a closet. They ordered the man to surrender – the suspect then opened the closet door and stabbed Otis with an 8- to 10-inch kitchen knife. Officers – “fearing for their life and the life of the canine” – fired their weapons, and the suspect fell to the floor. They attempted life-saving measures, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The two officers involved in the shooting were identified as: They have been placed on three-day standard administrative leave, according to the release. Three other officers who witnessed the shooting were also placed on leave. Otis was examined at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Hospital and suffered non-life threatening injuries.

(CBS4) – A 17-year-old is custody after a sheriff’s deputy was shot in Grand Junction on Monday. The Mesa County sheriff’s deputy, identified as Deputy Derek Geer, 40, was shot just after 11 a.m. He was responding to a call about a person wearing a black bandanna over his face and walking around with a gun. The shooting occurred in the 500 Block of Fruitvale Court. Residents told CBS4’s Matt Kroschel they called 911 when they saw the person running down the road. Henry Stoffel with the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said deputies approached the subject at which point Geer was shot multiple times. He’s listed in critical condition with life-threatening injuries. “Probably the most difficult day you could have in law enforcement,” Stoffel said. “One of your officers injured in the line of duty is very difficult for everybody. It’s a very traumatic event for the agency and the community as a whole.” A law enforcement source close to the investigation told CBS4 the injuries Greer suffered were grave. He’s a Navy veteran and father of two. He’s been with the sheriff’s office since 2001. “There were no shots fired by any of the deputies. The suspect was arrested a couple of blocks away hiding in a backyard,” Stoffel said. The suspect’s name hasn’t been released because he’s a juvenile. Schools in that area were put on lockdown. They were lifted at approximately 4 p.m.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":706,"startIndex":698,"value":"multiple"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":104,"startIndex":90,"value":"GRAND JUNCTION"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":307,"startIndex":300,"value":"11 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-22","details":{"endIndex":478,"startIndex":446,"value":"the 500 Block of Fruitvale Court"},"state":"CO - Colorado","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":125,"startIndex":123,"value":"17"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":278,"startIndex":276,"value":"40"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":274,"startIndex":264,"value":"Derek Geer"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A138BU1VWM2RKN

As the search for her killer continues, her grieving family and friends are making sure her legacy lives on. CBS 2’s Mai Martinez reports. Aaren O’Connor moved to Chicago from San Diego more than a year ago for a new job and to be closer to her boyfriend. Her father says he was fearful something bad might happen to her. Friday night, his worst fear came true. David O’Connor talked with his daughter, who complained of a pain in her head. “I didn’t realize at the time but I was just having the last conversation with my daughter,” he says. Neither he nor Aaren knew she had been shot in the head while sitting in her car outside her Pilsen apartment. The father only found out what happened after reaching Aaren’s boyfriend, who called her roommate to check on her. The roommate found Aaren unresponsive in her car. She was rushed to the hospital but died Sunday. “She was an amazing girl,” her father says. She continues to amaze her father, who just found out she was an organ donor. Another way Aaren will continue to give back for years to come is through a GoFundMe page established by her co-workers. The money raised will be used to help at-risk youth in Chicago and to fund a scholarship in Aaren’s memory. “It gives her life meaning, and I so appreciate it,” David O’Connor says.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":127,"startIndex":113,"value":"a stray bullet"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":35,"startIndex":28,"value":"Chicago"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-08","details":{"endIndex":806,"startIndex":770,"value":"her car outside her Pilsen apartment"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":488,"startIndex":483,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":307,"startIndex":293,"value":"Aaren O\u2019Connor"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9

This morning the FBI identified Roof—a 21-year-old with prior arrests for drugs and trespassing—as the man who shot up a Charleston church Wednesday, killing at least nine people in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack. Roof’s uncle, Carson Cowles, says he recognized his nephew when police released surveillance images taken outside the Mother Emanuel AME Church. “He’s a monster, and they need to catch him, and he needs to pay for what he’s done,” Cowles told the Daily News on Thursday. Cowles says his nephew was “a shy person who kept to himself” but tells the New York Daily News he “never saw” it coming. It’s unclear what kind of gun Roof allegedly used in the attack, but Cowles tells the paper Roof got a .45-caliber for his 21st birthday on April 3. Roof was thrilled when his dad gave him a .45 caliber gun when he turned 21 in April, Cowles said. Cowles called him a day later. “He said, ‘I got to go, I’m outside shooting target practice right now,’” he said. Roof is still at large.

Each 10th-grader was found with one gunshot wound outside the building, near the school’s cafeteria, Glendale police Officer Tracey Breeden said. A weapon was found near the bodies, Breeden said. When reporters asked whether this was a homicide-suicide or a double suicide, Breeden said she “can’t confirm anything,” but she said investigators don’t believe any shooter is at large. “We don’t believe that there’s any suspects that are out there … that we’re searching for,” Breeden said. Breeden said she didn’t know what relationship, if any, the girls had. Police asked students’ parents to gather at a nearby Walmart to await further information. Independence High School opened in 1977 and is part of the Glendale Union High School District. More than 2,000 students are enrolled. Glendale is a city of about 230,000 just northwest of Phoenix.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":98,"startIndex":90,"value":"GLENDALE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-11","details":{"endIndex":208,"startIndex":184,"value":"Independence High School"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":169,"startIndex":162,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":114,"startIndex":111,"value":" 15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":114,"startIndex":112,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3LZCR1FDVSVQ8
4342	http://cjonline.com/news/2014-05-27/topeka-homicide-victim-died-hours-after-her-wedding	Topeka homicide victim died hours after her wedding | CJOnline.com	Topeka homicide victim died hours after her wedding | CJOnline.comA central Topeka man heard vehicle engines ramping up and a long series of gunshots before a sport utility vehicle sheared off a utility pole and came to a stop across the street from his home. On Tuesday, Topeka police identified Tiffany Davenport-Ray, 42, a bride married just hours before she was killed, as an occupant of one of the vehicles. On Sunday morning, Topeka police arrested Awnterio D. Lowery, 30, in connection with attempted first-degree murder and booked him into the Shawnee County Jail. Lowery's bond initially was set at $500,000. But during his first appearance on Tuesday morning, Shawnee County District Court Judge Steven Ebberts set his bond at $1 million cash or surety due to the victim's death. As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, charges hadn't been filed in the case, said Lee McGowan, chief of staff in the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office. David Carroll said he and his wife were on the front porch of their house at 1900 S. Kansas Ave. trying to escape the heat early Sunday when he heard the engines of two vehicles running up in the 1800 block of S. Kansas Avenue, and it sounded as though the vehicles crashed together. "All of a sudden I heard bursts of gunshots," Carroll said. "I told my wife to get down. After the bursts stopped, I got up and went out to the road." The white SUV had been "bouncing off stuff and took out the phone pole," Carroll said. A utility pole about six yards south of the corner was sheared off. That SUV came to a stop near the southwest corner of 19th and Kansas. "I saw the occupants of that vehicle (get out) and go over that fence," Carroll said, referring to a fence just north of a house at 1911 S. Kansas Ave. Carroll, who didn't know what gender the two were, said the two went behind that house. Meanwhile, the second vehicle turned to travel west on 19th Street, Carroll said, but he didn't know what color it was or the make of that vehicle. Davenport-Ray was taken by private vehicle to an unspecified hospital with life-threatening injuries. She died about 3:15 p.m. Sunday. "I called 911," Carroll said, adding he placed the call at 1:41 a.m. Sunday. Carroll estimated he heard 40-plus gunshots firing with the same rapidity as a string of "Black Cat firecrackers." Topeka police used yellow tape to cordon off several blocks of S. Kansas Avenue north and south of 19th Street, he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Micki Martinez, a longtime friend of the victim and a Spotted photographer for The Topeka Capital-Journal, said she met Davenport-Ray about 25 years ago when they worked at Walmart. “She was a strong, spirited individual,” Martinez said. Martinez said Davenport-Ray had lived in Wichita for the past 10 years and had just returned to Topeka for her wedding Saturday. She worked at Beechcraft in Wichita. Martinez said Davenport-Ray has an adult daughter and a son who is about 12 years old. Her new husband also has children, she said. “She was fun to be around,” Martinez said of Davenport-Ray. “She brought a smile to everybody.” In a Facebook post Sunday afternoon, Davenport-Ray’s daughter, Destiny DeYanna, wrote about her mother’s happiness at her wedding. “It truly kills me that this has happened....mom you mean the entire world to me and I just wish I had that moment to tell you once more,” she wrote. “You fought hard, like you normally did. And I will forever look at ALL the pictures from yesterday to see your happiness shouting loud and clear.... Love you and I’ll see you soon! Promise.” Topeka police said they also booked Lowery into the Shawnee County Jail about 11:22 a.m. Sunday in connection with aggravated assault, criminal discharge of a firearm and distribution of certain stimulants. Lowery’s criminal history includes a 2004 conviction in Shawnee County court of criminal discharge of a firearm at an occupied dwelling and aggravated battery. Police continue to investigate. Anyone with information may contact Topeka police at 368-9551 or Crime Stoppers at 234-0007. We'll never know but, probably, street cred. Pathetic. Despicable. Satan is preparing a special place for you Awnterio. He's drooling at the chance to get you. I hope you enjoy the "sub-tropics." It'll make your pittance of jail time feel like a birthday party. May God have mercy on your soul. And....may his gentle hands hold Ms. Davenport's family in comfort and guide them to solace, understanding, forgiveness, and whatever peace is possible after something like this. I agree with the poster who questioned whether comments are appropriate. A normal, sane, empathetic poster will post either a) something about praying for her/her family, or b) shock and outrage that this could happen. Anything else is someone trolling. And since it is predictable (because it is an awful story), what do the comments add, really?	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":137,"startIndex":126,"value":"long series"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":438,"startIndex":431,"value":" Topeka"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"KS - Kansas","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":477,"startIndex":475,"value":"30"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":473,"startIndex":455,"value":"Awnterio D.

4353	http://cjonline.com/news/2013-10-10/man-custody-after-apartment-shooting-atop-huntoon-hill	Man in custody after apartment shooting atop Huntoon Hill | CJOnline.com	Man in custody after apartment shooting atop Huntoon Hill | CJOnline.comAn intense hour-plus manhunt Thursday night for a person being sought in the shooting of a woman at an apartment complex atop Huntoon Hill ultimately ended near where it began. Topeka police Lt. Chuck Haggard just after 10 p.m. said, “I think we got our guy,” who was apprehended on the grounds of the complex where the shooting occurred. Officers were summoned around 8:25 p.m. to a first-floor unit at 1306 S.W. Summit Woods Drive at the Overlook Apartments on a report of a possible shooting. A woman inside was suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, Haggard said, later indicating that her condition was “up in the air.” “It was a pretty chaotic scene,” he said. The person of interest was identified by Haggard as Sheek I. Azeez. A person matching his description was apprehended shortly before 10 p.m. several buildings further south in the complex from where the shooting scene was. Authorities late Thursday were attempting to positively identify the man. “He was wandering around the area where there’s parking and dumpsters, etc.,” Haggard said, also saying that he was unsure if the man had been driven back to the area by searching officers or a helicopter circling overhead. A firearm was recovered by authorities, Haggard said, but he wasn’t 100 percent certain where it had been found. Haggard said the initial 911 call to emergency dispatchers was a hang up and subsequent conversations were frantic but indicated a shooting had happened. After first-arriving officers got a grasp of the situation a large law enforcement operation ensued. Officers secured the scene, established a wide perimeter and posted lookouts nearby businesses on S.W. Arvonia and S.W. Wanamaker to prevent the shooter from gaining entry and possibly creating a sizable hostage situation. The Kansas Highway Patrol helicopter circled overhead as K-9 units ran trails and people mingled outside amongst a heavy police presence. Haggard said the helicopter was “very helpful” and works well not only as a search tool but as a deterrent from running, as well. Shawnee County District Attorney Chad Taylor also was called to the scene. Haggard described Azeez, the person of interest, as a 5-foot-6, 150-pound Asian male with a clean-shaven face and short black hair. Azeez was said to be wearing a black shirt with “Army” imprinted, black cargo pants, and red and white Reebok shoes. Initial reports indicated the shooter may have fled east on foot, but later information conflicted with that and led officers to encompass and comb a wide search area. Witnesses were taken to police headquarters to be questioned. The building where the shooting happened is a three-story structure at the north end of the complex near the entrance from S.W. Huntoon Street. Haggard said a primary concern of police was the possibility the shooter remained in the area. That scenario could endanger the complex’s residents, a number of whom came outside to survey the goings-on and ascertain what occurred. Officers went door to door to check the welfare of nearby tenants. He said the entirety of the operation spread manpower “a little thin” across the city, but officers were able to attain an apprehension. “We do pretty good police work,” Haggard said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":611,"startIndex":602,"value":"multiple "},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":255,"startIndex":249,"value":"Topeka"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":449,"startIndex":441,"value":"8:25 p.m"},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":505,"startIndex":476,"value":"1306 S.W.

Incident sent shockwaves through the quiet neighbourhood of district's Bohriband area, where the family lived. While locals say the ghastly incident was a result of pressure by moneylenders, police have ruled out any such possibility. Shashank Tiwari, 40, who owned a petrol pump, is understood to have been suffering from depression. Matter was informed to police by their domestic help at 10 am. Police said Shashank, his wife Mini Tiwari, 30, daughter Adhya, 12, son Avish, 8 were found dead with gunshot injuries on their head. Mini hails from a Malayali family from Bhopal. Her father T S K Nair was a government employee and her brother lives abroad. They have been informed.

According to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, the naked man was walking down a road near Delray Beach, Florida when, for reasons that remain unclear, he attacked a 66-year-old former NYPD officer. The retired cop was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries. Meanwhile, the naked man continued up the road, where he encountered and chased a man walking with his 10-year-old son. Later, the naked man attacked an 18-year-old man, biting his face until the teen stabbed the man with a box cutter or knife. By that time, police officers had arrived on the scene and attempted to Taser the nude man. "He's obviously delirious on something," Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told the Palm Beach Post. "He is a huge guy. He takes a fighting stance. They're trying to get him on the ground. He starts charging them. The Taser did not affect him." A deputy then shot the man three times, once in the torso and twice in the lower body. The man died later that night at a nearby hospital. "We don't know right now if he's expired from the gunshots, or if he's expired because of obviously he's on some type of drugs that have made him act like this," Bradshaw said. "There's no way to know if those are the shots that actually killed him, or if he's died from what they called exited delirium. He's obviously on some type of narcotics to make him act like this."

Michael B. Lancaster, 21, was arrested and charged with reckless homicide. Thursday morning, he was arraigned in Parma Municipal Court, where his bond was set at $25,000. "It's a very unfortunate situation. It's terrible what happened," said Lancaster's attorney Stephen McGowan. "There was no fight going on. There was no illegal activity. It was my understanding they were about to paint a room together. They were a close couple." Brooklyn police said Lancaster called 911 from his apartment on Ridge Road at about 7:39 p.m. Wednesday. He told dispatchers he shot his girlfriend in the chest. The victim, 18-year-old Olivia Stull, of Parma, was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center, police said. She later died from her injuries. Investigators said Lancaster pointed a .45 caliber handgun at Stull’s back, pulling the trigger to make a clicking sound and unaware it was loaded. “He has some weapons. He's usually careful, unloads them, disengages them then puts them away,” McGowan said. Lancaster remained on suicide watch, with McGowan asking that his client remain in custody. “I think it would be better if he's in custody so we can watch him and take care of him,” McGowan said. Stull’s family declined to comment when reached at their Parma home Thursday afternoon.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":90,"startIndex":82,"value":"BROOKLYN"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":704,"startIndex":696,"value":"7:39 p.m"},"date":"2016-02-04","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"OH - Ohio","time-day":{"endIndex":269,"startIndex":262,"value":"morning"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

On February 6, police in Chicago said that the Martinez family, whose identities were released yesterday, instead died as a result of a ??????targeted incident,??? according to an Associated Press report shared by ABC News. It was the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office who ultimately ruled that the deaths of all members of the Martinez family were homicides. Five of the family members were stabbed to death with the sixth dying from multiple gunshot wounds. All of the victims suffered blunt force trauma, according to ABC7 Eyewitness News in Chicago. The murder victims were identified as two men, Noe Martinez Sr., 62, Noe Martinez Jr., 32, two women, Rosaura Martinez, 58, Maria Martinez, 32, and two young boys, Leonardo Cruz, 13, and Alexis Cruz, 10. Maria Martinez is the only victim that was shot to death while the other five were all stabbed to death, according to NBC News. There is still no motive for the murders. Police in Chicago say that that the family members were targeted or that perhaps the murders occurred as part of a robbery or domestic incident. Responding to a 911 call, police were called to the home on Thursday to perform a welfare check when the caller said that one of the family members hadn???t been to work in two days. When police arrived on the scene, they could through a window that one of the family members was lying on the floor. After they got inside the locked home, some of the dead were found on the first floor with some bodies being discovered on the second floor. Police found no forced entry. The house did not appear to have been ransacked. Other members of the Martinez family have established a GoFundMe page with proceeds going to ???help send the bodies to Mexico and help with the funerals and burying ceremonies of all six members.??? As of this writing, more than $24,000 has been donated.

4480	http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/124957	Canadian Tourists Robbed at Gunpoint | Channel5Belize.com	Canadian Tourists Robbed at Gunpoint | Channel5Belize.com There was another sensational crime this weekend, in which two Canadian tourists were held hostage by armed robbers who then shot a man while stealing his vehicle to make their getaway. The first incident, the armed robbery, took place at the Tropical Education Center at mile twenty-eight on the George Price Highway. The shooting took place shortly after, on a stretch of the old Western Highway nearby. Mike Rudon was at the Center today and has the story. Mike Rudon, Reporting Canadian retirees Stephen Temple, seventy-five, and Cynthia Fredrick, sixty-five, checked into the Tropical Education Center at eleven Sunday morning. They were in this wooden cabin at the edge of a pond, a nature lover’s paradise, when the unthinkable happened just hours after. “We had a couple staying with us, checked in yesterday, and they reported that somewhere around three-thirty they were held up on the premises by two armed men. They were put inside their room and their personal items were stolen, cash and electronic equipment. Nobody was aware that it happened. We had several other guests staying with us and we had staff on site. It appears that the robbers gained access through the bushes. The woman told me that she went outside to take a photograph of the crocodile and that’s when she was accosted by the robbers.” Two men entered the cabin. As they left with cash and items including cameras, phones, tablets and cash, they told the couple that a third person would stay nearby to ensure that they did not raise an alarm. Operations Manager Celso Pott says that the Center has been in existence since 1994 and they have never had an incident like this. “It was definitely at random and I believe it was opportunistic because a lot of people traverse the old Western Highway…hunters…I mean we stay back here and we hear gunshots at night. We know when hunters are out. I think it was just a random opportunistic event for those fellows that were probably traversing the old Western Highway.” It is believed that the two robbers entered the property through the old Western Highway which borders it. They made their getaway through that same route. It is believed that the men laid their bicycles across the road to stop a red pickup being driven by Jorge Cruz Lopez. Lopez was shot to the back, and one of the men allegedly put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. The gun snapped repeatedly and that is when Lopez chopped the man across the arm. The two men then jumped in his vehicle and drove off towards the George Price Highway. Shortly after, Police would receive a report that a male person was at the K.H.M.H. seeking treatment for a chop across the arm. They responded immediately. Sr. Supt. Edward Broaster, Regional Commander, Rural Eastern Division “He inflicted a chop wound to one of the suspects who is at the K.H.M.H. under Police guard at this time. Our investigation is ongoing right now and more than likely we will have the suspect who is at the hospital charged for robbery, attempted robbery, aggravated assault and what have you.” That man under guard is allegedly Adolphus Palacio Jr., no stranger to Police. Palacio was arrested for attempted murder in 2014 after he allegedly shot a B.D.F. volunteer in La Democracia. The incident has galvanized the management of the Tropical Education Center and additional security protocols are being put in place. “We just actually finished a management meeting and we are going to improve our security to try and minimize this. We are out here in the wilderness. Actually the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center is about wildlife conservation, it’s about wildlife habitat management, wildlife habitat preservation, and this is what the people we have coming to Belize want to experience, and this is what we have to offer them. So as management we have put in place additional security measures to try and minimize these sorts of incidents. I mean, this could happen to anyone in Belize. We have people right around here get hijacked in their homes.” The Center evacuated all guests on Sunday night, just out of an abundance of caution. Police are seeking one other person in the broad daylight, brazen robbery and shooting.

A Modesto police spokesperson said the incident started when the officer pulled over a car on Prescott Road north of Plaza Parkway. According to Heather Graves, spokeswoman for the Modesto Police Department, the man who was shot got out of the car and ran. At some point as he fled, the Modesto police officer reported seeing a handgun. Graves could not say whether the man who was shot brandished that gun or pointed it at the officer. He did not fire it during the incident. Graves says a handgun was recovered from the scene. The Modesto police officer has been put on paid administrative leave, which is protocol in an officer involved shooting. Police have detained a number of witnesses, including the other occupants who were in the car when the man fled.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":67,"startIndex":60,"value":"MODESTO"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-14","details":{"endIndex":286,"startIndex":250,"value":"Prescott Road north of Plaza Parkway"},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A3QG7IEUSN13J3
4500	http://gazette.com/live-double-shooting-in-arizona/article/1569899	2 students killed in shooting at Phoenix-area high school | Colorado Springs Gazette, News	2 students killed in shooting at Phoenix-area high school | Colorado Springs Gazette, NewsGLENDALE, Ariz. — Two students were shot and killed Friday at a high school in a Phoenix suburb but the danger at the campus was over, police said, as hundreds of worried parents crowded outside nearby stores to await word on their children. Two 15-year-old girls were shot once at Independence High School, but it was not clear what led up to their deaths, Glendale Officer Tracey Breeden told reporters. Authorities were not looking for anyone else, and a gun was found near the bodies, she said. The circumstances suggested the possibility of a murder-suicide or double-suicide, but Breeden said no determination had been made. She had no information on the relationship between the girls, who died at the scene and were found near an administration building. Police arrived within two minutes of being called, and the school of more than 2,000 students went on lockdown, Breeden said. Hundreds of worried parents soon began arriving at nearby discount and convenience stores. Breeden told parents awaiting word on their kids that "your children are safe." Cheryl Rice said she went to a store after a friend called about the shooting and asked after Rice's 15-year-old daughter. But the girl called as Rice arrived at the store. "She said, 'I'm OK,' so I of course started crying," Rice said. She said it was horrible waiting for word about her child. "You don't know if it's your daughter or not. You don't know who's being bullied. You don't know who is being picked on. You don't know anything. It could be anybody," Rice said. School district officials said parents will be bused to the school to be reunited with their children. Other students who got permission from their parents left campus on their own. Glendale Union High School District alerted parents to the shooting through emails and automatic phone calls and released information on social media, Superintendent Brian Capistran said. Students typically are not allowed to use their cellphones during lockdowns, but as calls from parents flooded the district, officials asked teachers to have students call family, Capistran said. Social workers and counselors will be available to students and staff when school resumes Tuesday, the superintendent said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":368,"startIndex":364,"value":"once"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":98,"startIndex":90,"value":"GLENDALE"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":396,"startIndex":372,"value":"Independence High School"},"state":"AZ - Arizona","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":338,"startIndex":336,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":338,"startIndex":336,"value":"15"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3H48TMCITL94X

(CBS4) – The Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy shot and critically injured by a teen in Grand Junction has died. Sheriff Matt Lewis announced late Wednesday night that Deputy Derek Geer had passed away. He was taken off life-support after his organs were donated. Geer reportedly responded to a call Monday of a male walking along the road near the Grand Junction city limits, with a gun and wearing a bandana over his face. An altercation occurred, and Geer tried to use a stun gun to disarm the suspect, who then shot him multiple times. Austin Holzer, 17, fled the scene but was captured soon afterward. Funeral services for Deputy Geer will be held on Monday, Feb. 15, at the Canyon View Vineyard Church. On behalf of Deputy Geer’s family and the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, words can not adequately express our gratitude for the outpouring of support and compassion from our community during this most difficult time.

(WBFF) -- The community of Abingdon is grieving a day after a suspect fatally shot two Harford County Sheriff's Deputies. Gunfire erupted before noon on Wednesday at a Panera Bread restaurant at the Boulevard at Box Hill Shopping Center. The gunman, identified as 68-year-old David Brian Evans, shot and killed deputies Patrick Dailey and Mark Logsdon when they responded to a report of a suspicious person. The suspect, Evans, had an outstanding warrant in Florida for allegedly assaulting an officer. After Evans was approached by Deputy Dailey Wednesday at Panera Bread, he reportedly pulled out a gun and shot the officer. The gun he used was legally purchased in Pennsylvania in 1993. Evans then fled the restaurant and was tracked down 15 minutes later by Deputy Logsdon. Both Evans and Logsdon were killed in an exchange of gunfire. Flowers contributed by mourning locals lay at the shooting scene on Thursday, a delicate symbol of the lives lost in the line of duty.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":959,"startIndex":940,"value":"exchange of gunfire"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":115,"startIndex":107,"value":"ABINGDON"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-10","details":{"endIndex":358,"startIndex":289,"value":"Panera Bread restaurant at the Boulevard at Box Hill Shopping Center."},"state":"MD - Maryland","time-day":{"endIndex":270,"startIndex":259,"value":"before noon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Yes","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":387,"startIndex":385,"value":"68"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":414,"startIndex":397,"value":"David Brian Evans"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":472,"startIndex":460,"value":"Mark Logsdon"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":455,"startIndex":441,"value":"Patrick Dailey"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":387,"startIndex":385,"value":"68"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":414,"startIndex":397,"value":"David Brian Evans"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":472,"startIndex":460,"value":"Mark Logsdon"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME

4628	http://cjonline.com/news/2014-01-22/2-injured-one-critically-pine-ridge-shooting	2 injured, one critically, in Pine Ridge shooting | CJOnline.com	2 injured, one critically, in Pine Ridge shooting | CJOnline.comTwo people were injured — one critically — in a double-shooting Wednesday morning in the Pine Ridge housing complex on the city’s east side. Both victims were being treated Wednesday afternoon at a Topeka hospital. No one has been arrested, police said. Emergency responders were sent at 10:09 a.m. to the 2700 block of S.E. Gilmore Court on a report of two males who had been shot at a residence in the Pine Ridge housing area, located immediately north of Interstate 70 just east of S.E. Golden. Both shooting victims were taken to a Topeka hospital in separate American Medical Response ambulances. Police Lt. Ashraf Kaboudan said the shooting occurred in a one-story, red-brick duplex at 2724 S.E. Gilmore Court. Shortly after 10:40 a.m., police expanded the crime-scene zone to cover much of the 2700 block of S.E. Gilmore Court, including areas encompassing at least three brick duplexes on each side of the street. A police official Wednesday evening said there had been no attempt-to-locate bulletins for a suspect broadcast across law enforcement radio frequencies. In the minutes after the shooting, police could be seen talking with residents of the area, some of whom had come outside following the incident. David Rigby, 60, who lives about a half-block from where the shootings occurred, said he has lived in Pine Ridge — an area of one-story beige- and red-brick duplexes — since this past July and hadn’t encountered crime of any magnitude until Wednesday morning. Rigby described his time in the area as being “wonderful” to date. “As long as I’ve lived here, I’ve never had any inkling of any problems or commotions or sirens or gunshots or anything else,” Rigby said. “I saw this, and I was just in shock.” Rigby said he didn’t hear any gunshots Wednesday morning, but did hear sirens. He thought at first they may have been coming from nearby I-70 and were echoing and bouncing off the Pine Ridge buildings. Chantel Goodman said she lived next door to the building in which the shooting occurred, but said she wasn’t aware of any shots being fired. “I didn’t hear anything,” she said. “I was in the bedroom watching movies with my grandkids.” Goodman said she saw one of the victims outside the residence where the shooting occurred. About 24 police officers responded to the scene, including police officials from Topeka Unified School District 501, which runs Pine Ridge Prep, 1110 S.E. Highland Ave., about a block and a half northeast of the shooting site. Ron Brown, chief of school police for USD 501, said children were being kept inside the school and officers were placed on the perimeter as a precaution. “We put the school on lockdown,” Brown said, in accordance with standard procedure whenever there is a shooting reported near a school.

4658	http://fox59.com/2013/06/02/four-wounded-in-birthday-shooting/	Four wounded in birthday shooting | Fox 59	Four wounded in birthday shooting | Fox 59After four young people were shot at a birthday party late Saturday night, Metro police will review the operating permits and past code violations of the owner of the social club where the shootings occurred. A large bullet hole shattered the plate-glass window and blood still stains the sidewalk outside of 1913 East 46th Street, where IMPD reported up to 100 young people running and brawling in a panic after gunfire erupted outside Sweet 16 birthday party. One youth told Duane White of the Ten Point Coalition that he feared he was about to be attacked by three members of an eastside gang. “A group of guys inside got into it and a chair flew across the room and a fight happened and that’s when security pushed the crowd out,” said White. Once the mostly teenage crowd exited the building, a least five shots were fired. None of the wounds were life threatening as one victim told Fox 59 News he was, “in the wrong place at the wrong time,” and that there were at least three fights inside the party before the shooting. Saturday night’s shootings mark an escalation in youth violence. More than a dozen reports detail brawls and threats by young people downtown in the weekend before the recent Indianapolis 500 Mile Race. IMPD was called to break up a fight at the Marion County Health Department at 4012 North Rural Street Friday night as a graduation party swelled to approximately 400 people. Metro Police Chief Rick Hite is expected to unveil plans this week to combat violent crime in Indianapolis this summer. “We’re in the right places and we’ve identified the right people and we’re getting some of the right results.” Public Safety Director Troy Riggs has been briefed on Hite’s plans for undercover and targeted patrols over the last two months. “I don’t want people to think that we’re waiting on this plan,” said Riggs. “Chief Hite has already instituted changes and you’re already going to see some wins that have already occurred from this plan.” Dozens of wanted persons and felons and a number of guns have been seized in the crackdown which began in the spring. “You’re going to see uniforms and you’re not going to see uniforms,” said Hite, alluding to undercover investigations relying on informants and other evidence. “I think we have a good idea what’s happening in our neighborhoods and in those areas where we know that crime exists. We know we’ll see uniforms…visible uniforms…in those neighborhoods, but in those areas where its covert, you may not necessarily see them, but it’s there.” Riggs said a group of potential offenders and victims will get special attention from IMPD. “We have five thousand individuals coming back to this community every year from prison,” said Riggs. “Five thousand. 1500 of these five thousand have never lived in this city before.” Hite said officers are working closer with the Department of Corrections and the Marion County Probation Department to identify those people. “We’ve identified targets over the year. Some have come back from prison. Some have been lingering for decades. Some families have been operating in this town for a very long time with impunity. We’re just sending a message in a strong way that’s not going to happen much longer.” Police commanders have also encouraged beat officers to emphasize legitimate traffic stops in the search for potential warrant violators and suspected felons. On the city’s northwest district, of approximately 30,000 traffic stops in the last year, one in 11 contacts led to arrests on traffic or other charges, though officers have the option to issue warnings instead. Many of the stops result in arrests for weapons, probation violations or outstanding warrants.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":858,"startIndex":840,"value":"a least five shots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":1554,"startIndex":1542,"value":"Indianapolis"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-04-03","details":{"endIndex":372,"startIndex":340,"value":"outside of 1913 East 46th Street"},"state":"IN - Indiana","time-day":{"endIndex":1085,"startIndex":1080,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A1X0H6VAK3AQE9

At 4:10 a.m., Riley County police officers responded to a complaint of multiple shots fired at 900 Garden Way in Manhattan. Shortly after arriving on scene, officers found several people with gunshot wounds. One person was found with a fatal wound. One person was taken into custody. The person’s name is being withheld at this time because of an ongoing investigation, officers said. Three people were transported to Manhattan area hospitals. The names of the victims were being withheld, too, pending further investigation and next-of-kin notification. “The Riley County Police Department does not believe this incident poses any further danger to the public’s safety,” a news release said. Matthew Droge, public information officer for the police department, said he didn’t anticipate any more information would be released until Monday. Going off statistics it was probably another drug related incident that involved illegally obtained (IE stolen) weapons. The problem in our country isn't legal gun owners, its psychotic individuals obtaining stolen weapons then using them for violent purposes. We as US citizens should stand up & demand that our political leaders drop the gun control BS and start enforcing the laws we already have because more often then naught criminals are getting sweetheart deals for deplorable violent acts. If any new gun related laws must be enacted let them simply state as such. "If a firearm is used in the act of a crime then the criminal shall serve an additional 5 years after their initial sentence, doubled to 10 years if a violent act is committed while in possession of said firearm" Then simply toss the violent SOB's in prison, I don't care if its over crowded let them sleep in shifts. If there isn't enough food make them share. If they need something to do then make them work. etc.. etc... etc.. just keep them the heck away from everyone else in society.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":294,"startIndex":280,"value":"multiple shots"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":166,"startIndex":157,"value":"Manhattan"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":221,"startIndex":212,"value":"4:10 a.m."},"date":"2016-03-21","details":{"endIndex":318,"startIndex":304,"value":"900 Garden Way"},"state":"NY - New York","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	AI4J8TH0Y11X5

4740	http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/09/us/nypd-officer-trial/index.html	Peter Liang: NYPD officer's case goes to the jury - CNN.com	Peter Liang: NYPD officer's case goes to the jury - CNN.comProsecutor Joe Alexis argued that Liang showed poor judgment, again and again, and that the shooting wasn't an accident beyond the officer's control. He asked jurors to hold Liang accountable. The trial has garnered attention beyond New York due to the national controversy over charges that police are too quick to use lethal force, sometimes against unarmed individuals. Outrage over police shootings or excessive use of force has spurred protest movements in major cities such as Chicago, Baltimore and New York. In the most well-known cases -- the fatal shootings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, and the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in Baltimore -- the victims were unarmed black men. Gurley was shot in the chest and died at a hospital in November 2014. The next day, New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the 28-year-old was "a total innocent" who fell victim to "a very unfortunate tragedy ... involving an accidental discharge." On Tuesday, the defense told jurors that Liang handled his firearm as trained, and that the video of the crime scene shows that having his weapon drawn in the darkness of the stairwell was the correct course of action. Liang gave tearful testimony on the stand Monday, just before both sides rested in the case. He lost his composure when asked to recount what happened in the stairwell on that night. "I was panicking. I was in shock, in disbelief that someone was actually hit," he said. The prosecutor has accused the rookie officer of recklessly shooting into a dark stairwell "for no reason." "Then, instead of doing all that he could to help Akai Gurley, he wasted precious time arguing with his partner about calling for help," Assistant District Attorney Marc Fliedner told jurors last month. "In fact, instead of calling for help, he just stood there and whined and moaned about how he would get fired." Liang's lawyer has argued that the officer's gun accidentally discharged when he had it out while on patrol in the dangerous building. He was in shock, she said, and didn't know Gurley had been shot. "He's shaken and terrified and totally, and I mean totally, unaware that a bullet has struck anything," Koshetz said. When Liang and his partner went back into the stairwell to investigate, they discovered Gurley and his girlfriend on a stair landing below, Koshetz said. "The evidence in this case will show that this was a million-to-one possibility. The bullet had traveled downward, hit the cinderblock wall on the side of the stairs and then ricocheted and hit Mr. Gurley a floor below and completely out of sight. And it hits him on his left side," she said. "It is a fatal wound, and you will hear that no amount of CPR would have saved his life." Gurley's family was less than sympathetic at a Monday afternoon news conference. "Peter Liang says that it was an accidental death. Peter Liang, my son was no accident," said Sylvia Palmer, the victim's mother. "You murdered my son. I need justice for my son. I need a conviction of Peter Liang." Stepfather Kenneth Palmer said the trial has taken its toll on the family. "If you fire a gun and you know you're guilty, say 'I'm guilty' and that's it," he said. "Don't put any family through what we're going through." The 2014 shooting death came amid strained relations between police and the community, just a few months after the death of Eric Garner as police tried to arrest him on Staten Island. The chokehold death of Garner, an unarmed 43-year-old man, sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute the officer. Liang was indicted a year ago. If he's convicted of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

(AP) — A 21-year-old western Michigan man charged with wounding three people in a shooting outside a high school basketball game has had previous weapons convictions. MLive.com reports (http://bit.ly/1XlKiM6 ) Thursday that Clarence McCaleb has been convicted as an adult of carrying a concealed weapon and drug possession, and as a juvenile for firing a gun at a vehicle in 2010.

Police said the men most-likely used a pellet gun, but left a car outside with multiple shattered windows. "I thought someone was going to die, someone is going to get shot," said Wayne Malitz, who was home when the crime happened. Malitz said he was standing with his son-in-law outside their home off Beltline Road when a red truck pulled up outside and began firing shots at a car parked out front. According to Malitz, the men were driving a red Ford Explorer sports utility truck and they were wearing masks. Malitz said he "definitely [felt] in danger with that kind of stuff going on." He said whoever pulled the trigger failed to realize there was three children sleeping in the house. Malitz is thankful no one was hurt. "It really infuriated me with what was going on," Malitz shared. Since the Malitz's security camera footage wasn't on when the crime happened, they don't have any other evidence other than what they saw. A few other neighbors with camera systems have offered to look if they captured any video of the truck driving down the street. Redding police are asking for any information leading to the arrests of the individuals involved. If you know anything regarding this incident, please call the Redding Police Department at 530-225-4200.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":255,"startIndex":245,"value":"pellet gun"}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":87,"startIndex":80,"value":"REDDING"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-29","details":{"endIndex":523,"startIndex":504,"value":" off Beltline Road "},"state":"CA - California","time-day":{"endIndex":205,"startIndex":199,"value":"night."}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":398,"startIndex":386,"value":"Wayne Malitz"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":[]}]}	A2HS7Q2MMN5MME

Provincial police officers were called to the home around 7:30 a.m. There, they found Bernard Cameron, 65, dead. Bernard’s 28-year-old daughter, Sarah Cameron, had also been shot and sustained what police called life-threatening injuries. Her former common-law partner and the father of her two children, Travis Porteous, 33, from nearby Carleton Place, was suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police sources said. Porteous and Sarah Cameron were taken to different hospitals, one air-lifted. On Thursday evening, police confirmed Porteous had died. Sarah was in stable condition in hospital. Porteous arrived at the home and is believed to have started arguing with Sarah. At some point, Bernard became involved and police said Travis shot his children’s grandfather dead. Sarah’s mother, Catherine, then ran upstairs, with Travis and Sarah’s four-year-old daughter and five-year-old son, who were inside the home. Police then believe Travis shot Sarah before shooting himself. Cameron’s home, situated on a sprawling, fenced property, was also his childhood home, where he grew up with his mother and father, an army colonel. Cynthia Guerard, the owner of My Upholstery Shop, became emotional when speaking about him. She had visited his home many times over the years, and to think it is now a taped off crime scene was unfathomable. “He was a nice guy, I’d see him at every auction sale and garage sale,” she said, joking that they would often compete for the same items. “He was always one of those people who got involved and loved everybody,” said Guerard. “He and Catherine were high school sweethearts. She was a Dunn, from a large family. The families have have been here for five or six generations. It’s going to hit a lot of people.” Anyone with information is asked to call OPP at 1-888-310-1122.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":258,"startIndex":244,"value":"outside Ottawa"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":327,"startIndex":318,"value":"7:30 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-11","details":{"endIndex":222,"startIndex":204,"value":" politician\u2019s home"},"state":"Outside the USA","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Yes","The shooting was self-directed.":"Yes"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":584,"startIndex":582,"value":"33"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":580,"startIndex":565,"value":"Travis Porteous"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":365,"startIndex":363,"value":"65"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":361,"startIndex":346,"value":"Bernard Cameron"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]},{"age":{"endIndex":385,"startIndex":383,"value":"28"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":418,"startIndex":405,"value":"Sarah Cameron"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]},{"age":{"endIndex":584,"startIndex":582,"value":"33"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":580,"startIndex":565,"value":"Travis Porteous"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A2ZRF4I5RTKN7G

(CBS4) – One man was killed after he was shot multiple times in a mobile home park in Boulder on Friday morning. Several hours later, deputies arrested two people in connection with what has been determined to be murder. Shots rang out at a trailer home at approximately 8:15 a.m. at 4475 North Broadway, according to the Boulder County Sheriff. The victim was found lying outside on the ground. He was rushed to the hospital and died soon afterwards. The man has not been identified. Neighbors woke up to gun shots, and others, later, to questions from law enforcement. “It freaked me out to have somebody dead in Ponderosa Pines,” said Howie, who stays in the area and did not want his last name used. Deputies interviewed two people who were in the home at the time as well as people in nearby mobile homes. Based on those interviews, deputies arrested two people, Cody F. Nelson and Miriam L. Nayeh. Nelson, 51, was arrested for murder in the first degree and prohibited use of a weapon. Nayeh, 31, was arrested for accessory to murder in the first degree and domestic violence. “Investigators are speaking with the two people that came from the trailer plus we’re also speaking with all of the witnesses, people that heard the gunshots. People that live adjacent to the area. And we’ll try to piece things together and figure out how what happened,” Boulder County Sheriff’s Commander Heidi Prentup told CBS4 before the arrests. Deputies continued to investigate what may have led up to the shooting. Shining Mountain Waldorf School was placed on lockdown as a precaution for a short time.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":323,"startIndex":308,"value":" Shots rang out"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":181,"startIndex":174,"value":"Boulder"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":368,"startIndex":359,"value":"8:15 a.m."},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":391,"startIndex":372,"value":"4475 North Broadway"},"state":"CO - Colorado","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":1002,"startIndex":1000,"value":"51"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":970,"startIndex":956,"value":"Cody F.

4886	http://dailyorange.com/2012/10/victim-of-gun-violence-shares-responds-to-letter-column-about-campus-concealed-carry-laws/	Victim of gun violence responds to letter, column about campus concealed carry laws | The Daily Orange – The Independent Student Newspaper of Syracuse, New York	Victim of gun violence responds to letter, column about campus concealed carry laws | The Daily Orange – The Independent Student Newspaper of Syracuse, New YorkI’m writing in response to Tiernan Mendes’ Oct. 3 letter to the editor, which challenged Harmen Rockler’s Oct. 1 column on campus concealed carry laws. Gun laws are deeply personal for me: I was shot and almost killed this summer in a theater in Aurora, Colo. Getting blasted with more than two dozen shotgun pellets didn’t suddenly make me a firearms expert, but it gave me some insight into the cost of America’s broken gun laws. I understand Mendes’ hope that things might have gone differently in Aurora had there been “a gun in the crowd,” but I know better than he just how misguided that reasoning is. The theater instantly became a warzone; as the dark auditorium filled with smoke, innocent bystanders ran about chaotically and the shooter stalked his victims with several weapons and full body armor. I’m alive for only two reasons: The shooter’s high-capacity rifle magazine jammed and the police arrived in less than two minutes. Allowing civilians to more freely carry concealed weapons isn’t the best solution to our country’s persistent gun violence. It’s tempting to believe a gun, in the right hands, could save the day, but the data don’t bear this out convincingly on a large scale. Studies have concluded it’s basically impossible to determine if there’s a causal link between concealed carry and crime rates. Any police officer will tell you adding guns to a dangerous situation won’t make it safer. I’m not arguing law-abiding citizens don’t occasionally prevent crimes with concealed weapons, but I trust their ability to do so far less than that of trained professionals. Some states don’t require safety or range training to obtain a concealed carry permit, by the way. The very people who tell me I should carry a gun to stop shootings refuse to entertain even the most basic measures to prevent those shootings from happening in the first place. Roughly 40 percent of guns are sold privately, which means they aren’t accompanied by a background check under federal law. We should require background checks for every gun sale, while also filling the massive gaps in mental health records submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In the words of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in District of Columbia v. Heller, “the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,” and prohibitions on concealed carry — especially in “sensitive places such as schools and government buildings” — have been declared constitutional in the past. In a country with nearly as many guns as people, we can never fully prevent criminals from obtaining weapons, but we can make it harder by introducing common-sense regulations that don’t infringe upon the rights of law-abiding gun owners. I may no longer be a student, but I’ll always remain deeply concerned about my alma mater. The data, as well as my own personal experience, don’t suggest that allowing concealed carry on campus will make Syracuse any safer, but improving background checks will. Mr. Barton has experienced very real emotional and physical trauma. As a healthcare professional, I identify and understand that. I am also grateful that he recognizes a violent experience does not an expert make. I have spent years researching and debating this issue. I don’t know that I am considered an “expert” but I have spent years documenting incidents of civilian use of firearms for self-defense, and I can tell you it happens multiple times every single day. Mr. Barton says this is only “occasional.” He is entitled to his opinion, but he is not entitled to misrepresent the facts. (Look up the paper “Tough Targets: When Criminals Face Armed Resistance from Citizens” or the numerous studies that have been done by government agencies.) The simple reality is that civilians PREVENT crimes at rates enormously higher than law enforcement. This makes sense when law enforcement is summoned only after an incident. Mr. Barton was in a theater which obligated its patrons to disarm. Historically, mass shooters prefer college campuses due to their no-gun policies. In March, Colorado began allowing licensed concealed carry. The Aurora shooter chose a gun-free theater instead. Is there a connection? I don’t know…if you were bent on mass murder, which would you choose? A classroom where someone might shoot back, or a building which mandates being defenseless? A two minute response time? That’s almost unheard of in medium to small sized cities. It Tallahassee where I am from the average response time in the city is 8 minutes, 15 if you are in the county. I hate to play the “what if” game but if that had been in Tallahassee or another city than we could have had 4 times the amount of victims, or since I live in Florida and do not have to legally disarm myself due to a sign on a door I can have at the very least a chance to protect myself. When you get down to it the data firmly supports private gun owners as capable, reliable and relatively safe and effective at stopping violent situations. You can try to undermine correlation, or list testimonials like this one or from numerous police chiefs but ultimately all those fears, all those claims, all the paranoia amounts to nothing, such things just haven’t happened. The fears of “shootouts at the OK Corral” never materialize, civilians don’t wind up in wicked crossfires as half a dozen people all respond to a situation and shoot each other, it just… doesn’t happen. Scores of schools in multiple states allow concealed carry already, some for more than a decade, and such disasters have not unfolded. Instead counties and states with higher rates of concealed carry and private ownership do see decreased rates of violent crime, now correlation does not equate causation but it can certainly imply it and the numbers point towards private firearm ownership, not against. Now I don’t think anyone is arguing that concealed carry is the only solution, better training for law enforcement personnel, more rapid response times, more and better security personnel and better integrated mental health data in background checks would all certainly help decrease violent crime and the likelihood of a mentally unstable individual obtaining firearms. However none of those measures mean much when the proverbial defecation strikes the oscillation and people live or die by what they do in the moment and the data shows when people react and stop the threat the average number of victims goes down dramatically. And the best way to stop an armed attacker is to be armed yourself. Like Mr Burnett, I am also grateful that Mr Barton recognizes the value in his experience and that it alone does not make him an expert. I wish he could recognize that what it really does is cloud his perception of the truth. Truth is absolute. Our perception of it is not. Like Mr Burnett, I have also spent considerable time researching and debating this issue. The truth is that only one mass shooting (defined by the FBI as a shooting in which there are four or more victims) since World War II has occurred in areas where lawful carry of firearms was permitted. The truth is that firearms ownership is at a self-reported twenty-year high, that in the past twenty years states have been restoring the right to carry concealed firearms, and that last December was the single most active month in history for licensed sales. The truth is that this proliferation of firearms and the right to carry them has helped trend violent crime nationwide down for the past five years. The truth is that mass shootings, while tragic, are still rare and that robbery, assault, and rape both on campus and directly off are not. The truth is that every year a firearm is successfully used in self-defense one million times. The truth is that campus concealed carry will not only restore the right a student has to refuse to be a victim, but the deterrent will make campus safer as well. Fact: There are certain places and situations which, when guns are thrown into the mix, have a much higher chance of ending in disaster. them at the door. Now let’s go a step further and think of a place that the availability and prevalence of guns in the U.S. today, I think that infinitely generalized; we need to think twice about high-risk areas, and the college campus being one of them. To get to your other points, David, I think you’re off the mark for two more reasons: policies. You say you’ve done a lot of research on the issue – any depression, and suicide in the U.S.? What’s more, the base premise that “mass shooters prefer college campuses” is itself incorrect; a quick significant “preference” for college campuses as opposed to cafes, movie theaters, hair salons, etc. prevention” claim – and a lot of conjecture on both sides. Given the study you can refer us to? Maybe the “numerous studies that have been done by government agencies” would be a good place to start. First, I recommend going to concealedcampus.org. All your questions about evidence and citations are addressed in the most common arguments section. You point out colleges as being high risk, but also say that there is no preference for criminals towards them. Then what, to you, makes them high risk? Also, let’s just move past the overused argument of colleges being full of drugs, alcohol, and all the rest. Yes, it happens it the age group, but generally off campus, and actually it’s not as rampant as everyone makes it seem. Plus, those who apply for permits cannot have any major psychological disorders and they are taught that it is fully illegal to drink any carry their weapon. Not to mention they must be over 21 in the first place, and much of the partying and drinking is done underage. We are citizens trusted by the state to carry anywhere else in public. Why would our capacity and competence to do so responsibly change on a bit of sidewalk labeled as “school?” America’s gun laws are not broken. If they were followed by every person in the country, there wouldn’t be nearly as much of a problem. That is to say, if there were no criminals, there would be no problem. The nature and definition of a criminal is thus: They don’t follow laws. Enacting any new laws does exactly jack squat to those who could not care less about breaking the ones already in place. All they would do is restrict the people who obey, thus putting them at the mercy of the criminals. Clearly, in the incident Mr. Barton endured, the shooter was not doing something legal, so more laws really wouldn’t have done much to deter it. Additionally, getting mental records to NICS is the duty of the individual states, and I admit that many are lacking in their responsibility. However, saying that every weapon sale must have a background check is similar to saying every car sale must be through a dealer. You can only do a 4473 form and call it in to NICS is you have an FFL (Federal Firearms License). So in order to put that practice into place, the implication is that everyone who owns a firearm must also then get the license to be a firearms dealer, just in case they ever want to sell one. 1) The site is well put together, but it doesn’t actually address my questions in #2 above. 2) As a student myself, I have to say that you seem to be a little misled about drinking in college. A few things you should know: 1) it’s very prevalent; 2) it’s mostly done in on-campus housing; and 3) 21+ and 21- students mix freely and frequently. If the ConcealedCampus has convinced you on the premise that the culture is not this way, maybe you need to re-evaluate your conclusions. what I wrote? “Criminals” do not equate to “mass shooters”; “preference” obviously relatively high-risk, but let me make it more explicit: I am also a student right now, and in 3 years in my current school and the 2 at the one before there have been 0 student deaths between them. And my current school being in Utah, concealed carry is wholeheartedly legal. Also, while I know people do sneak alcohol into the housing, wild drunken parties haven’t been happening around me for the 5 years of my college education. It’s more like my roommate buying a 6-pack every couple weeks or a bottle of Jack that lasts all semester in my experience. If they did any heavier drinking, it was at someone else’s house, not in the dorms. But it doesn’t factor into the argument of how those who obtain the permit to conceal because we are fully aware that carrying while drinking is illegal. Also taught to us before we can obtain the permit, which one would wish didn’t have to be actually taught, is that brandishing due to a personal argument is not legal. We are trained not to pull the weapon until there is physical danger. Your suggestion is that once anyone has a gun they will look for any excuse to use it, which is just not true. Nothing of note has happened on any of the Utah campuses since CC was legalized, and neither in Colorado. If you don’t feel comfortable carrying, that’s fine, but you cannot objectively tell how others will handle the responsibility. So far, the theories of increased violence and irresponsible students doing all manner of stupid things with their weapons have never panned out when campus concealed carry is instituted.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":160,"startIndex":151,"value":" New York"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-31","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"Unclear","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

John Helmholdt with Grand Rapids Public Schools released a statement Monday evening: “Working closely with our colleagues in Muskegon Heights, we mutually agreed that it is in the best interest of our students and families to cancel tonight’s games while the community is still heeling from last week’s incident.” The shooting happened Feb. 9 following the game between Ottawa Hills High School and Muskegon Heights High School. Four people, including two Muskegon Heights students, were injured in the shooting. They have all since been released from the hospital. Clarence Jamichael McCaleb, 21, is charged in connection with the shooting. He was arraigned Feb. 10 on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, felony firearm and carrying a concealed weapon. The Muskegon County Prosecutor’s Office says he could face additional charges. According to the Muskegon County Prosecutor, McCaleb was confronted by a Muskegon County Sheriff’s Deputy after the initial shooting. The deputy wounded McCaleb in the confrontation. The prosecutor’s office says that the investigation so far shows the deputy took the necessary action to save his life and save others at the scene. According to detectives, McCaleb told them that he had gone to Muskegon Heights to watch the basketball game. He ran into a group of people at the game and went out to his car to get a gun. He told police that when he tried to leave, the group of people ran at him and he fired shots into the crowd. Officials say McCaleb fired at least three shots, then ran away and fired into the air.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":1809,"startIndex":1760,"value":"three shots, then ran away and fired into the air"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":101,"startIndex":85,"value":"MUSKEGON HEIGHTS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":677,"startIndex":564,"value":"The shooting happened Feb. 9 following the game between Ottawa Hills High School and Muskegon Heights High School"},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":846,"startIndex":844,"value":"21"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":842,"startIndex":816,"value":"Clarence Jamichael McCaleb"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[]}	A15L4M23LKUZZI

It happened near mile marker 99 in Crisp County. The incident began about 4:00 p.m. when an Ashburn Police officer tried to pull over a car for a tag violation near mile marker 82 on I-75. The driver did not stop, and a chase began on the Interstate. Officers with the Crisp County Sheriff's Office joined the chase north on I-75. During the chase, GBI agents said those in the car began firing at the officers. Georgia State Patrol and Turner County Sheriff's deputies arrived as the chase ended. Somehow, a female Ashburn Police officer and a male Turner County deputy were wounded, apparently by "friendly fire." GBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Terry Howard said, "The officers that were injured was a result of shots fired from other officers. The investigation is ongoing. There are a lot of evidence that's got to be collected and processed." A male suspect in the car died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. We're told he has a long criminal history. A woman in the car was injured and taken to a hospital. We believe she was shot. Both wounded officers were treated at a hospital and released. Transportation officials shut down all lanes of I-75 North near the location and detoured drivers for about three hours, and reopened them just before 9 p.m. Thursday. Copyright 2016 WALB.

Officer Sean Bolton saw an illegally parked car on the streets of Memphis, pulled up in front of it and shone his spotlight. When he approached the vehicle, a passenger confronted him. A struggle ensued, and the passenger shot Bolton multiple times, authorities said. The car drove off, leaving the officer for dead. "Officer Bolton apparently interrupted some sort of drug transaction," Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said. "A digital scale and a small baggie of marijuana ... were located inside of the vehicle." Suspect named Memphis police identified Tremaine Wilbourn, 29, as the suspect. He is on the run, and considered armed and dangerous. The violence was senseless given how mundane the stop was, Armstrong said. "We're talking about less than 2 grams of marijuana. You're talking about a misdemeanor citation," he said. "We probably would not have even transported for that." Bolton loved to read, work out Nearby residents heard the gunshots late Saturday night and used Bolton's radio to call for help. Emergency crews took him to a hospital in critical condition, where he was later pronounced dead. Armstrong described the suspect as a "coward." "You gunned down, you murdered a police officer, for less than 2 grams of marijuana," he said. "You literally destroyed a family." Friends described the Iraq veteran as a gentle man who did not believe in using force. "For a police officer to have that kind of temperament, and to take such a cautious approach to the use of force, he was a credit to the uniform," his friend Steve Clements told The Commercial Appeal newspaper in Memphis. Bolton was quiet, and loved to read and go to the gym, friend Minda Klitzner told the paper. So much so, he'd read in the car during road trips. Fallen officers Bolton, 33, is one of 19 officers killed nationwide this year by violent suspects. The deaths at the hands of suspects run the gamut -- veterans and rookie officers -- and span the nation -- from Georgia to California "Last night, we lost not only an officer, but a great man, a dedicated servant to our community and a family member," Armstrong said. This is the third time a Memphis police officer has been killed in the past four years. Driver turns himself in The vehicle's driver later turned himself in and was released without charge. Authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Wilbourn's arrest. He is out on supervised release for a 121-month sentence for robbery, according to Armstrong. Bolton was turning 34 this month.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":388,"startIndex":374,"value":"multiple times"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":213,"startIndex":206,"value":"Memphis"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-08-03","details":{"endIndex":202,"startIndex":195,"value":"streets"},"state":"Tennessee","time-day":{"endIndex":125,"startIndex":112,"value":"weekend night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Yes","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":725,"startIndex":723,"value":"29"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":721,"startIndex":704,"value":"Tremaine Wilbourn"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":2667,"startIndex":2645,"value":" turning 34 this month"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":473,"oldEnd":472,"oldStart":457,"startIndex":458,"value":"Officer Bolton "},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	AE3XJ3B4K4B15

Around 8:15 a.m., Boulder dispatchers received multiple reports of two shots being fired and a woman screaming at Ponderosa Mobile Home Park north of Broadway and Violet Avenue. This evening, the Boulder County Sheriff's Office identified the suspected shooter as Cody Nelson, 51, and announced he had been arrested and transported to the county jail for first-degree murder and prohibited use of a weapon. Also arrested was Miriam L. Nayeh, 31, for accessory to murder in the first degree and domestic violence. Boulder sheriff's Cmdr. Heidi Prentup said that when deputies arrived, they found a 31-year-old man outside a trailer with multiple gunshot wounds and transported him to Boulder Community Health, where he was later pronounced dead. The Boulder County Coroner's Office identified the man as Andrew Duncan, 31, a transient in the Boulder area. Around 8:50 a.m., deputies could be seen taking a man into custody at gunpoint. Prentup said that a man and a woman were inside a trailer that officials surrounded, and said the female was also being taken for questioning. "We're trying to figure out what happened," Prentup said. "It's still very preliminary." Officials have not yet said how the two men knew each other, but the neighbor, Zahira Romero, said Nelson and the victim were roommates. Romero said she was inside her home just down the street when she heard the gunshots. She said her aunt lives right next to the trailer where the shooting took place and she called Romero. "She said, 'I need you to call the police, there are gunshots next door,'" Romero said. "I never would have thought anything like that would happen here." Romero said she used to live with her aunt and so she had talked with Nelson several times. She said he worked as a mover, and would sometimes ask her whether she wanted toys or other items he picked up while on jobs. "He would just say, 'Hi,'" Romero said. "He would just say what he needed to and leave. He wasn't especially friendly." Romero said she did not know the name of the victim, just that he had been living with Nelson. She said she thought the woman involved in the case lived in a neighboring trailer. A prosecutor with the Boulder County District Attorney's Office was on scene, and the sheriff's office will lead the investigation even though Boulder police personnel were also there. Shining Mountain Waldorf School was placed on lockout, but that has since been lifted. Residents in the area received a reverse 911 call to remain inside, but that order also has been lifted.

Officials spent hours searching the mobile home and the area behind it, looking for clues. They found a gun they believe was used during the shooting, but they haven't said who they think pulled the trigger. According to family members of the man who owns the mobile home, the victim is a 17-year-old girl from Bluffton. At the time of the shooting, she was visiting her boyfriend. It was around 3:45 a.m. when they were told she had been shot in the head. The family says they were told the teen and her boyfriend were home alone when it happened. Deputies have not released the girl’s identity or her condition. Her boyfriend’s mother told WTOC that doctors declared her brain dead. She says her son tried to save her. “He was giving her mouth to mouth. Oh, God! I just feel so bad. In my heart I don’t feel like he did anything to hurt her. I wasn’t in the house. It’s not a good feeling. It’s a horrible feeling as a mother to know that someone else’s child lost their life in my son’s house,” said Sherry White, homeowner’s mother.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-03-02","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Yes","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A2U4H12NH6Z4QL

Glendale police spokesperson Tracey Breeden said officers responded to calls of a shooting at Independence High School near 75th and Glendale avenues just before 8 a.m., right around the time school is scheduled to begin for the day. — Anthony Cave (@Anthony_Cave) February 12, 2016 WHAT HAPPENED? Police found two 15-year-old female sophomores lying next to each other on campus, each dead from a single gunshot wound, said Breeden. A weapon was found next to them. Breeden said a suicide note was also located at the scene, leading detectives to believe one of the teens shot the other before turning the gun on herself. Teacher Phuong Kieu talked to ABC15 Friday afternoon and identified her sister May as one of the victims. Police have not yet confirmed the victims' identities. RELATED: Sister speaks out about teen killed in shooting According to Breeden, the investigation has revealed the two girls were very close friends and appeared to also be in a relationship. Police referred to the situation as an "isolated incident," and were quick to reassure parents that their children "are safe" and that this was not an active shooter-type situation. — Nick Ciletti (@NickCiletti) February 12, 2016 Detectives say they are not looking for any other suspects or persons of interest. A student says she was shocked to learn that two teens died in a shooting at her school. Senior Lanie Walter said Friday that the shooting was heartbreaking because "everyone is so loving" at Independence High School. She says she heard ambulances on her way to the campus in Glendale but didn't think much of it until her first class went on lockdown. — Nick Ciletti (@NickCiletti) February 12, 2016 She called her parents to tell them she was OK and said her mother was relieved because she had been watching the news. The principal of Independence High School sent a letter to parents which reads: It is with a heavy heart I inform you that a tragedy occurred at Independence High School today. Before the start of school today, two female students lost their lives while on campus. The school was immediately placed in lock down and the Glendale Police Department responded quickly, assessing the safety of our students, faculty and staff. The Glendale Police Department secured the scene and immediately began their investigation. We are working in partnership with the police department as the investigation continues. As stated in the media press conference, this tragedy was an isolated incident. There was never an active shooter on campus and police are not searching for a suspect. Our hearts and minds are with the families who lost their children today. We offer our deepest condolences. As an Independence community we will support the families and each other. We will be providing a team of social workers for our students and families tomorrow (Saturday, February 13). They will be available from 9 a.m. to noon in the Media Center. As well, the team will be available to support students when they return to school on Tuesday. We thank you for your support and understanding as our community deals with this tragedy. — ABC15 Arizona (@abc15) February 12, 2016 ABC15 reached Glendale Vice Mayor Ian Hugh by phone Friday. He called the shooting "a horrible tragedy" and said that city employees are following the developments. Seventy-Fifth Avenue was closed between Glendale Avenue and Bethany Home Road while police worked to clear the scene. The road was re-opened around 2:30 p.m. GOV. DOUG DUCEY: 'OUR HEARTS REMAIN WITH THE STUDENTS, EDUCATORS AND FAMILIES' Gov. Doug Ducey released the following statement as new information was released. "As details of this morning's tragic shooting continue to be released, our hearts remain with the students, educators and families of Independence High School and the entire Glendale community." He thanked first responders, police, teachers and school administrators for their "swift response and diligent work" to keep the area safe. "Our thoughts and prayers are with them, with everyone on scene and with the community during this difficult time," his statement read. Independence High School is part of the Glendale Union High School District. It joined the district in 1977, according to the school's website. GUHSD has nine high schools that cater to 15,000 students in Phoenix and Glendale, according to its website.

The woman heard about three other people enter her home. One man was about 5 feet, 4 inches tall and was wearing saggy pants and a plastic mask. The woman heard people moving around upstairs while the man with the gun ordered her to empty all of her drawers and open all of the cereal boxes.

Shawn Henry Allen Dickens, 30, of Mena died of gunshot wounds after an altercation with a Mena police officer. He succumbed to his injuries at Mena Regional Health System. As of Tuesday afternoon, two investigations were underway: The Mena Police Department was conducting an internal investigation on whether policy was followed, and Arkansas State Police were investigating the shooting, authorities said. Bill Sadler with ASP said an investigation into the shooting is being prepared and will be submitted to a prosecuting attorney to determine if the use of deadly force by the officer was necessary and consistent with Arkansas laws. The officer, whose name has not yet been released, approached Dickens outside of Kess Korner, a convenience store located at 1513 Reeves Ave. A physical altercation developed before Dickens fled on foot. As he fled, he dropped a handgun, according to ASP. Mena police told ASP investigators that Dickens returned to pick up the gun he had dropped, according to ASP. The officer commanded the man to stop and move away from the gun. When Dickens ignored the orders, police shot, officers told ASP. Dickens’ body will be taken late Tuesday or early today to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory for examination to determine the manner and cause of death. The investigation continues, Sadler said.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":154,"startIndex":150,"value":"Mena"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-16","details":{"endIndex":954,"startIndex":910,"value":"convenience store located at 1513 Reeves Ave"},"state":"Arkansas","time-day":{"endIndex":165,"startIndex":155,"value":"about noon"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":204,"startIndex":202,"value":"30"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":200,"startIndex":175,"value":"Shawn Henry Allen Dickens"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1ISQWPY0S1OKQ

Louisiana State Police reported Emily Thibodeaux, 23, of Addis, was shot when her husband, Ivy Thibodeaux, 29, an Addis police officer, was cleaning his gun and accidentally fired. Thibodeaux had just started her career as a third grade teacher at the Holy Family School in Port Allen. Funeral services will be held at St. John the Baptist Church in Brusly on Saturday. A growing memorial in Thibodeaux's honor has been set up outside of Holy Family School on Jefferson Avenue. Father David Allen said his school is truly saddened by the loss of a truly great teacher and spirit. "Although our time might be brief, as it was for Emily there's no wasted life," he said, "It's all precious. She touched countless numbers in a short period of time and it was a sign in the proof that the Spirit of God is in someone." The school will have grief counselors on hand to talk with students and faculty who may need help dealing with the sudden loss. Thibodeaux also coached the school’s cheerleaders. Allen said explaining a tragedy like this to elementary-aged children is particularly tough. "This is a human tragedy that makes no sense and so we don't ask 'why' we say 'what.' What do we do? We turn to one another and let God with skin: family, friends, the church to embrace us, love us and heel the pain, emptiness and confusion," he said. Troopers said the shooting happened in the 3600 block of East Nic Drive in Addis just before 3:45 p.m. Friday. They added Emiley Thibodeaux was rushed to the hospital where she later died.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":1651,"startIndex":1645,"value":"Addis "},"clock-time":{"endIndex":1672,"startIndex":1663,"value":"3:45 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":1641,"startIndex":1613,"value":"3600 block of East Nic Drive"},"state":"Louisiana ","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Yes"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Yes"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":340,"startIndex":338,"value":"29"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":336,"startIndex":322,"value":"Ivy Thibodeaux"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":283,"startIndex":281,"value":"23"},"gender":"Female","name":{"endIndex":279,"startIndex":263,"value":"Emily Thibodeaux"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A1N2EKNG64S9I6

The incident occurred at a house in Moo 2 village in tambon Thakham. It was reported to the police about 8.30am. Somchai Thaihuan, the kamnan of tambon Thakham, told police that the man, Pornpichit Yongstar, had separated from his wife after the two had frequently quarrelled. Mr Pornpichit went away for two or three years to work in other provinces. He returned home on Sunday hoping to reunite with his wife. His wife refused to get back together, leading to a heated quarrel last night. Mr Pornpichit went berserk and shot dead his two daughters, aged 14 and 7, and two sons, aged 12 and 3, inside the house. After that, he went after his wife, but she managed to flee to safety. Police rushed to the scene and surrounded the house, trying to talk him into laying down his weapon and surrendering. His mother was also at the scene. As of noon, the man had still not surrendered. Police continued trying to persuade him to give up. They feared he may kill himself. The man was barricaded in a room alongside the two-storey house. Rescue workers had already brought out the bodies of the four children, found on the second floor of the house. Police said neighbours heard sound like gunshots around 2am, but paid no further attention. They learned only later in the morning that the man had killed his offspring.

A release from the Republic Police Department said Destry Meikle, 48, was shot after officers responded to reports of a crash near South Peachtree Lane and East Elm Street. When they arrived, they found a single vehicle had collided with two different buildings before coming to rest in a garage. An officer — unnamed in the release — approached the vehicle and began telling the driver to shut it off, before Meikle put the vehicle in gear in an attempt to leave the scene, according to the release. The release then says the officer was knocked to the ground, and when getting up, believed the vehicle was going to strike him again. The officer then fired his handgun, hitting Meikle, according to the release. Meikle was taken to a local hospital and treated, but eventually succumbed to his injuries, according to the release. The officer was treated and released for his injuries, and has been placed on administrative leave, in accordance with department policy. Republic Police Chief Mike Lawton said the Greene County Sheriff's Office would be investigating the incident. Several Republic police officers and Greene County Sheriff's deputies responded to the scene in addition to firefighters and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper. Michael and Amanda Hilles live across the street from the crime scene. They said they saw the suspect drive through a couple of yards and then they heard gunshots. Rachael Tate, another neighbor, said there might have been a small fire after the car crashed into the garage. Tate said normally Peachtree Lane is a quiet street. "Ordinarily this is a really safe street," Tate said. "There are a lot of neighbors who are home in the middle of the day, so we are always watching each other's houses." Lawton said Tuesday afternoon there had been no arrests in the case, and he was not sure if the suspect who was shot was involved in any other incidents in town on Tuesday. Lawton said the officer who was hit by the car was an "experienced officer." The scene is one block off of Highway 60. Police surrounded several homes with crime scene tape.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-16","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"No","The firearm was used in self defense.":"No","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"No"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"No","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"No","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"No","The firearm was stolen.":"No","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"No"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed","injured"]}]}	A2EMDOJ3A87QTI

The man, whose name was not disclosed, pulled into the parking lot of University Village near I-215 about 7:30 p.m. after calling police. The Lincoln, detailed with the words "Luxury Ryda," still has paper plates. The low-rider has small tires. There were four bullet holes on the right side, from back to front, and the rear windshield and rear passenger window were shot out. Riverside police Sgt. Debbie Foy said a bullet went through-and-through a headrest and another went through-and-through one of the man's legs. He was taken to Riverside Community Hospital. Foy said the man said he didn't know why someone would shoot at him. The man said he had been at the KFC on Perris Boulevard at Alessandro Boulevard, and that the shooting happened near Alessandro and Heacock Street, Foy said. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department is investigating the shooting because it apparently happened in an area it patrols.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":482,"startIndex":464,"value":" four bullet holes"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":131,"startIndex":118,"value":"Moreno Valley"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":324,"startIndex":315,"value":"7:30 p.m."},"date":"2016-02-07","details":{"endIndex":991,"startIndex":962,"value":"Alessandro and Heacock Street"},"state":"","time-day":{"endIndex":147,"startIndex":142,"value":"night"}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"No","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"No","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured","hospitalized"]}]}	A3I3F5BPVCPEQT

Santiago Bravo, 34, was killed outside his home near 17th Street and McDowell Road on Tuesday, Feb. 9. [RELATED: Man shot, killed outside Phoenix home] "I wait for him to come home, but he don't come," his mother, Maria, said. "I want to get out of this nightmare. It's just a nightmare." Police said the man was in his backyard when he was shot and made his way out to the street where he collapsed. His family says witnesses saw Bravo stumbling in his front yard. He was hunched over and holding his stomach. "He suffered. He suffered and he was fighting for his life," Bravo's mother said. Bravo's family was looking forward to celebrating his 35th birthday in March. "He left seven children behind. He left a family that loved him," Bravo's mother said. They are now looking for his killer. "We're not [going to] rest until this person is found," Bravo's mother said. "This wasn't right. This was not right for you to do this. I don't know who you are, but you know what? God knows." Bravo's mother says his family wants her son to be at peace, but that can't happen unless someone steps forward. "I know in my heart somebody saw something. Somebody had to see something," she said. "I pray that someone out there says something." The family is selling what they can and have set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to cover funeral expenses.

11551	http://guardianlv.com/2016/02/fargo-police-officer-dies-after-standoff/	Fargo Police Officer Dies After Standoff | Guardian Liberty Voice	Fargo Police Officer Dies After Standoff | Guardian Liberty VoiceOn Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016, a Fargo police officer died after responding to a domestic disturbance call that eventually led to an 11-hour standoff. Jason Moszer was the first officer in Fargo, North Dakota, to die in the line of duty in over 130 years. The Fargo Police Department was alerted about the disturbance at approximately 8:30 p.m. CST on Wednesday. Marcus C. Schumacher, 49, had reportedly attempted to shoot his wife in their home, as their son dialed 911 during the incident. Schumacher’s wife and son were able to escape the scene unharmed. Moszer was among the many Fargo police officers that responded to the residence. He was along the perimeter with the other officers as they awaited the SWAT team’s arrival. However, Officer Moszer was shot when Schumacher began shooting at the police from inside the house. An armored police car was used to carry Moszer out of the area and immediately transported to a nearby hospital. Fargo police continued to communicate with Schumacher throughout the night. The SWAT team eventually made their way into the home and recovered Schumacher’s lifeless body. He was found dead from a gunshot wound. It is unknown if the kill shot was from the police or self-inflicted. No one else was injured in this standoff, although many neighbors were aware of the incident. Sarah Stensland, 26, lives less than a block away from Schumacher’s residence and reacted when she heard gunfire. She locked the doors, turned the lights off, and hid in the basement for the rest of the night with her girlfriend. This was not the first time Schumacher was involved with the police. He was convicted in a negligent homicide case in 1989. He was sentenced to five years in the shooting death of 17-year-old Maynard Clauthier and the wounding of 21-year-old Bradley Boswell in Grand Forks, N.D. Schumacher chose to plead guilty in this case, in exchange for fewer felony counts, but then withdrew his plea. He was also sentenced to 30 days in jail and a year of probation for disorderly conduct and assault in January 2013. Schumacher had been facing financial issues. He and his wife filed for personal bankruptcy in 2004. It was reported that they listed more than $470,000 in debts and $75,000 in assets. Moszer, who died shortly after the Fargo standoff ended, was the first officer to die in the line of duty in over 130 years. The last time an officer fell in the line of duty was on July 5, 1882, when Officer Frederick Alderman was accidentally shot. He was 25 years old. Mayor Tim Mahoney made a public statement after the death of Moszer. He stated the city was “profoundly saddened” by his death. Officer Moszer won a Silver Star commendation in 2011, when he and his partner, Matthew Siders, risked their lives to rescue two children from an apartment fire. The two officers further assisted in putting the blaze out. As a result, the Silver Star medal was in recognition of their act of bravery and heroism. He is survived by his wife, Rachel, a son, and daughter. They stood along Moszer’s hospital bed after being notified he was not expected to survive from the single gunshot wound. Consequently, over 200 people gathered for a candlelit vigil, in honor of Moszer, late Thursday night. He was the only police officer that was injured in Fargo’s standoff late Wednesday night.

By Sky News US Team A police officer in Fargo, North Dakota, has suffered a "non-survivable" gunshot wound in a shootout with a domestic violence suspect, say authorities. Jason Moszer, 33, who was parked outside the home after responding to the call, was injured as the gunman fired multiple rounds. The suspect was found shot dead early on Thursday in the home where he had barricaded himself for about 11 hours. Fargo Police Chief David Todd said he did not know if the gunman had shot himself or if he was hit in an exchange of gunfire with a SWAT officer. A tearful Chief Todd told a news conference Mr Moszer's family were at his hospital beside, where "they are in the process of saying goodbye to him". He added: "Tonight the Fargo Police Department is mourning the loss of our brother officer." The gunman has been identified by authorities as 49-year-old Marcus Schumacher. The siege began after the suspect was reported to have fired a gun at his wife. Police were alerted by a 911 call from the gunman's son. The caller and his mother were able to escape the home unharmed. The suspect then called dispatchers and told them to evacuate nearby houses because he planned to open fire. Court documents show Schumacher had a previous conviction for disorderly conduct in January 2013. He received a 30-day suspended jail sentence and served a year of probation. Mr Moszer would be only the second Fargo police officer ever to be shot dead in the line of duty, reports the Forum newspaper.

Around 3:24 p.m., NOPD First District Officers responded to a shooting with multiple victims. Upon arrival, officers learned four males had been struck by gunfire after an apparent argument at the location. Based on the initial investigation, detectives learned that a group of individuals were driving ATVs and had arrived at the location to get gas. At that time, a man driving a white Volvo, later identified as Richard Macklin, pulled up to the gas station where he and the group began to argue. Macklin then pulled out a weapon and fired several shots at the group, striking three males ages 30, 31 and 32. One of the victims then pulled out a weapon and returned fire, striking Macklin in the head. All four of the individuals who were shot were brought to the hospital where they are recovering from what are believed to be non-life-threatening injuries. During the course of the investigation, detectives determined that Macklin was the aggressor in the incident. He will be booked once he is released from the hospital. The other individual who returned fire will not be booked in the shooting. At this time, detectives believe it was an act of self-defense. He was also carrying a legal weapon, that was registered to him and that he had a concealed carry permit to carry. I live in Treme, and we definitely have a gun violence problem here. And since gun nuts are the first folks screaming NIMBY, maybe let’s not encourage more folks to carry by pointing to a rolling shootout in a highly populated urban neighborhood full of families and kids as evidence that we need more guns?	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":777,"startIndex":770,"value":"several"},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":97,"startIndex":92,"value":"Treme"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":242,"startIndex":234,"value":"3:24 p.m"},"date":"2016-02-05","details":{"endIndex":225,"startIndex":214,"value":"gas station"},"state":"LA - Louisiana","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":657,"startIndex":642,"value":"Richard Macklin"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}}],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":826,"startIndex":824,"value":"30"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":830,"startIndex":828,"value":"31"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":837,"startIndex":835,"value":"32"},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]},{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":657,"startIndex":642,"value":"Richard Macklin"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["injured"]}]}	A13WDAXLRNII3N

By Sky News US Team Police are hunting a gunman who shot dead a one-year-old girl as she lay in her cot in the gang-ridden Los Angeles suburb of Compton. The suspect got out of a car and fired at a converted garage where the child lived with her parents. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said its deputies found the infant with a gunshot wound to her head after they were called to the home at 7pm on Tuesday. A witness told the Los Angeles Times she heard several gunshots, and the girl's mother, Blanche Wandick, screaming: "They shot my baby." The infant's tearful father was seen emerging from the garage with the little girl in his arms. According to the newspaper, homicide detectives believe the 24-year-old father, an admitted local gang member, may have been the intended target. The victim was named as Autumn Johnson. Police transported her in a patrol car to hospital, where she died from her injuries. Cornell Patton, Autumn's great-uncle, told KTLA-TV: "An innocent little girl lost her life yesterday over some foolishness. "If black lives matter, man, let's make it matter then.

Hendricks had estimated the crowd at 50,000 people and police were already dealing with heavy traffic. "We are roping off the area and collecting evidence and trying to deal with traffic". We thought it was fireworks at first, ' Celeste Plaisance told the Sun Herald. According to The Sun Herald, the bodies of the victims laid only 20 feet apart and have been covered. At first I thought it was fireworks, but we shoot guns, so I wondered if it was gunshots. Carlos Bates, 29, and 43-year-old Isiah Major III were killed, both dying on the spot from gunshot wounds. When she saw someone had been shot and people were fleeing, she ran inside for safety. Police remain at the scene.

(AP) – Authorities have jailed a 21-year-old man suspected of shooting and wounding three people outside a western Michigan high school basketball game. The Muskegon County prosecutor’s office said Wednesday that Clarence McCaleb, of Grand Rapids, was arraigned on assault and gun charges after being treated for his own gunshot wound. Police say a sheriff’s deputy shot McCaleb after McCaleb pointed his gun at him following Tuesday’s attack outside Muskegon Heights High School. McCaleb is being held on two bonds totaling $500,000. His lawyer, Adam Masserang, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Police allege that McCaleb shot and wounded two females and a male after the boys varsity game between Muskegon Heights and a Grand Rapids school. Officers were in the parking lot before the game because they had been warned about possible trouble.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":100,"startIndex":84,"value":"MUSKEGON HEIGHTS"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"date":"2016-02-10","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"MI - Michigan","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"Not mentioned","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was self-directed.":"Not mentioned"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Yes","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[]}	A1CBGORBVB8A44

Earlier Monday, a man was wounded in a Marquette Park neighborhood shooting on the South Side.

The man was shot in the head and left shoulder and was taken to Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where his condition was stabilized. A police source said he is a documented gang member. At 5:53 p.m. Sunday, four people, including two 15-year-old boys, were shot in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side.

The crime scene stretched for a couple of hundred feet on South Green Street. Derrick Francis, 60, who lives a few doors down, said he heard nine shots. He said he jumped to the floor as he was watching the Super Bowl. He said his 15-year-old nephew, Byron Daniels, was shot in the leg. My nephew “is a great kid, smart kid,” Francis said. “There’s no reason for the killing, its just b——-.” Another neighbor heard eight or nine teenagers on the porch screaming and ran out of the house to check on them. “Little girls and young boys — just talking to each other,” the neighbor said. “They weren’t harming anybody.” One of the teenagers who did not get shot told the neighbor that two people walked up and asked them, “Are y’all good?” And then one of the two started shooting and then they jumped into a truck. “I was telling them to put pressure on their wounds because one of the boys was throwing up,” the neighbor said. “Everybody was crying.” At least 15 other people were shot in Chicago between 5 p.m. Friday and 6 a.m. Monday.

Riverdale Police said 41-year-old Scott Sandlin was the man who called 911 and said he shot and killed his girlfriend, 30-year-old Jenna Manuel, in self-defense late Sunday night. Officers said Sandlin told them he shot his girlfriend because she was armed with a knife. According to Riverdale Police, Sandlin and Manuel lived in the home with Manuel’s 8-year-old daughter who was there during the shooting. Investigators are working to determine whether this is a case of self-defense or murder after finding Manuel who had been shot multiple times and killed.

13708	http://gazette.com/man-killed-in-alaska-police-shooting-was-lawmakers-nephew/article/feed/315732	Man killed in Alaska police shooting was lawmaker's nephew | Colorado Springs Gazette, News	Man killed in Alaska police shooting was lawmaker's nephew | Colorado Springs Gazette, NewsANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A volunteer fire official who died in an officer-involved shooting in a northern Alaska community was the nephew of a state lawmaker. Vincent Nageak III, who died in the shooting early Wednesday morning involving North Slope Borough police in Barrow, was related to Rep. Benjamin Nageak, a Barrow Democrat. The police officer involved was responding to a call for officer assistance about 3:38 a.m. Wednesday when the shooting occurred, borough spokesman John Boyle said in a news release. The officer, whose name is being withheld for 72 hours, was not injured. Police are not releasing further details. The lawmaker's office released a statement from the lawmaker and his wife, Bonnie, that says their "hearts and minds are still reeling" over the news and that they still don't know all the facts. His office said he was trying to catch a flight home to Barrow from Juneau. Vincent Nageak had been employed as the borough's acting volunteer fire chief for Barrow, Boyle said. House Speaker Mike Chenault, R-Nikiski, released a statement Wednesday afternoon on behalf of the state House, saying lawmakers were sending condolences and "our greatest sympathies and prayers to Ben, Bonnie and the rest of the Nageak family." The statement said lawmakers were honoring the family's request for privacy and patience. Barrow, 725 miles north of Anchorage, also was the site of a December 2014 shooting in which a state prosecutor was killed. A man accused of shooting Assistant District Attorney Brian Sullivan in a jealous rage over a woman is charged with first- and second-degree murder. He is tentatively scheduled for trial in late May. In Wednesday's shooting, the borough has asked for the help of Alaska State Troopers and referred further questions to that agency. Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said no additional details were immediately available.	{"circumstances":{"number-of-shots-fired":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"type-of-gun":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"date-and-time":{"city":{"endIndex":1436,"startIndex":1429,"value":" Barrow"},"clock-time":{"endIndex":515,"startIndex":505,"value":"3:38 a.m. "},"date":"2016-02-09","details":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"state":"AK - Alaska","time-day":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""}},"radio1":{"The firearm was used during another crime.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was used in self defense.":"Not mentioned","The incident was a case of domestic violence.":"No","The shooter and the victim knew each other.":"Not mentioned"},"radio2":{"Alcohol was involved.":"Not mentioned","Drugs (other than alcohol) were involved.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was a suicide or suicide attempt.":"No","The shooting was self-directed.":"No"},"radio3":{"The firearm was owned by the victim/victims family.":"Not mentioned","The firearm was stolen.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was by a police officer.":"Yes","The shooting was directed at a police officer.":"Not mentioned","The shooting was unintentional.":"Not mentioned"},"shooter-section":[],"victim-section":[{"age":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"gender":"Male","name":{"endIndex":268,"startIndex":250,"value":"Vincent Nageak III"},"race":{"endIndex":-1,"startIndex":-1,"value":""},"victim-was":["killed"]}]}	A3H48TMCITL94X
